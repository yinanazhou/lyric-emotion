You didn't think they could hate you, now did you? You didn't think they could hate you, now did you? Ah, but they hate you, they hate you 'cause you're guilty  So I stayed out all night in Ibiza By way of San Sebastian Where they said \"yankee, you better watch what you're saying Unless you're saying it in Basque or in Catalan\"  Then all the way east to Novi Sad Nary a bridge was to be seen But mother Russia, she laid her pontoons on down So I crossed over, if you know what I mean  Then on the road to Damascus Yes, the scales, they fell from my eyes And the simplest lesson I learned at the Mount of Olives That everybody lies  And the French Foreign Legion You know they did their best But I never believed in T.E. Lawrence So how the hell could I believe in Beau Geste, huh?  You didn't think they could hate you, now did you? You didn't think they could hate you, now did you? You didn't think they could hate you, now did you? Ah, but they hate you, they hate you 'cause you're guilty And...  You didn't think they could hate you, now did you? You didn't think they could hate you Why would you think they would hate you, now would you? Ah, but they hate you, make no mistake they hate you  I spent a night in Kigali In a five diamond hotel Where maybe someday they'll do the Watusi On down in Hutu hell  I fell in with the merchant marine Who promised to take me home But when I woke up all beaten and bloodied I couldn't tell if it was Jersey or Sierra Leone Come on!  You didn't think they could hate you, now did you? You didn't think they could hate you, now did you? You didn't think they could hate you, now did you? Ah, but they hate you, they hate you 'cause you're guilty So...  You didn't think they could hate you, now did you? You didn't think they could hate you Why would you think they would hate you, now would you? Ah, but they hate you, make no mistake they hate you  And the knocking in my head Just like the knocking at my door And maybe it was me or maybe it was my brother But either me or me and him went down to the bar  Where I got seven powers in me For to give me the cure When seven Powers failed to spin me I had to get me seven more  And when I say me I mean my brain (when the cocaine hits me) And when I say give me the cure I mean to kill the pain  And when I say kill the pain I mean to get the devil out And when I say devil I mean the manifestation of doubt What about!  You didn't think they could hate you, now did you? You didn't think they could hate you, now did you? You didn't think they could hate you, now did you? Ah, but they hate you, they hate you 'cause you're guilty And...  You didn't think they could hate you, now did you? You didn't think they could hate you Why would you think they would hate you, now would you? Ah, but they hate you, make no mistake they hate you",
