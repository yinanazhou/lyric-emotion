What good am I if I know and don't do If I see and don't say, if I look right through you If I turn a deaf ear to the thundering sky What good am I?   What good am I while you softly weep And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try What good am I?   What good am I then to others and me If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see If my hands are tied must I not wonder within Who tied them and why and where must I have been?   What good am I if I say foolish things And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings And I just turn my back while you silently die What good am I?1",

Hard-headed bastard, maybe he'll listen in his casket The aftermath: more bodies bein' buried I'm losin' my homies in a hurry, they're relocatin' to the cemetery Got me worried, stressin', my vision's blurry The question is will I live, no one in the world loves me I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feelin' this anger Don't wanna make excuses 'Cause this is how it is, what's the use?

        "2016 White House Correspondents' Dinner Speech   You can't say it, but you know it is true.  Good evening everybody. It is an honor to be here at my last, and perhaps the last White House correspondents' dinner. You all look great. The end of the Republic has never looked better. I do apologize. I know I was a little late tonight. I was running on CPT, which stands for jokes that white people should not make. That's a tip for you, Jeff.  Anyway, here we are, my eighth and final appearance at this unique event. And I am excited. If this material works well, I'm going to use it at Goldman Sachs next year. Earn me some serious Tubmans. That's right. That's right.  My brilliant and beautiful wife Michelle is here tonight. She looks so happy to be here. It's called practice. It's like learning to do three-minute planks. She makes it look easy now. But...  Next year at this time, someone else will be standing here in this very spot and it's anyone guess who she will be. But standing here I can't help but be reflective and a little sentimental.  Eight years ago I said it was time to change the tone of our politics. In hindsight, I clearly should have been more specific. Eight years ago, I was a young man full of idealism and vigor. And look at me now, I am gray, grizzled and just counting down the days to my death panel. Hillary once questioned whether I would be ready for a 3 a.m. phone call. Now, I'm awake anyway because I have to go to the bathroom. I'm up.  In fact somebody recently said to me, 'Mr. President, you are so yesterday. Justin Trudeau has completely replaced you. He is so handsome and he's so charming. He's the future.' And I said 'Justin, just give it a rest.' I resented that.  Meanwhile, Michelle has not aged a day. The only way you can date her in photos is by looking at me. Take a look.  Here we are in 2008. Here we are a few years later. And this one is from two weeks ago.  So time passes.  In just six short months, I will be officially a lame duck, which means Congress now will flat out reject my authority, and Republican leaders won't take my phone calls. And this is going to take some getting use to. It's really gonna... It's a curve ball. I don't know what to do with it. Of course, in fact, for four months now congressional Republicans have been saying there are things I cannot do in my final year. Unfortunately, this dinner was not one of them.  But on everything else, it's another story. And you know who you are, Republicans. In fact, I think we've got Republican senators Tim Scott and Cory Gardner. They are in the house, which reminds me ... security bar the doors. Judge Merrick Garland come on out. We are going to do this right here. Right now. It's like the Red Wedding.  But it's not just Congress. Even some foreign leaders, they've been looking ahead, anticipating my departure. Last week, Prince George showed up to our meeting in his bathrobe. That was a slap in the face. A clear breach of protocol.  Although, while in England I did have lunch with Her Majesty the Queen, took in a performance of Shakespeare, hit the links with David Cameron. Just in case anybody is still debating whether I am black enough, I think that settles the debate.  I won't lie, look, this is a tough transition. It's hard. Key staff are now starting to leave the White House. Even reporters have left me. Savannah Guthrie, she has left the White House press corps to host the Today show. Norah O'Donnell left the briefing room to host CBS This Morning. Jake Tapper left journalism to join CNN.  But the prospect of leaving the White House is a mixed bag. You might have heard that someone jumped the White House fence last week, but I have to give the Secret Service credit. They found Michelle and brought her back. She's safe back at home now. It's only nine more months, baby. Settle down. And yet somehow, despite all this, despite the churn, in my final year my approval ratings keep going up. The last time I was this high, I was trying to decide on my major. And here's the thing, I haven't really done anything differently. So it's odd. Even my age can't explain the rising poll numbers. What has changed nobody can figure it out. . Puzzling.  Anyway. In this last year, I do have more appreciation for those who have been with me on this amazing ride. Like one of our finest public servants, Joe Biden. God bless him. I love that guy. I love Joe Biden. I really do. And I want to thank him for his friendship, for his counsel, for always giving it to me straight, for not shooting anybody in the face. Thank you, Joe.  Also, I would be remiss. Let's give it up for our host, Larry Wilmore. Also known as one of the two black guys who's not Jon Stewart. You're the South African guy, right? I love Larry. And his parents are here, who are from Evanston, which is a great town. I also would like to acknowledge some of the award-winning reporters that we have with us here tonight. Rachel McAdams, Mark Ruffalo, Liev Schreiber. Thank you all for everything you have done. I'm just joking. As you know, Spotlight is a film, a movie about investigative journalists with the resources and the autonomy to chase down the truth and hold the powerful accountable. Best fantasy film since Star Wars.  Look. That was maybe a cheap shot. I understand the news business is tough these days. It keeps changing all the time. Every year at this dinner somebody makes a joke about Buzzfeed, for example, changing the media landscape. And every year The Washington Post laughs a little bit less hard. Kind of a silence there. Especially at the Washington Post table.  GOP chairman Reince Priebus is here as well. Glad to see that you feel you have earned a night off. Congratulations on all your success, the Republican party, the nomination process. It's all going great. Keep it up. Kendall Jenner is also here. And we had a chance to meet her backstage. She seems like a very nice, young woman. I'm not exactly sure what she does, but I'm told that my twitter mentions are about to go through the roof.  Helen Mirren is here tonight. I don't even have a joke here, I just think Helen Mirren is awesome. She's awesome. Sitting at the same table I see Mike Bloomberg. Mike, a combative, controversial New York billionaire is leading the GOP primary, and it is not you. That has to sting a little bit. Although it's not an entirely fair comparison between you and the Donald. After all Mike was a big city mayor. He knows policy in depth. And he's actually worth the amount of money that he says he is.  What an election season. For example, we've got the bright new face of the Democratic party here tonight, Mr. Bernie Sanders. There he is, Bernie. Bernie, you look like a million bucks. Or, to put in terms you'll understand, you look like 37,000 donations of $27 each.  A lot of folks have been surprised by the Bernie phenomenon, especially his appeal to young people. But not me. I get it. Just recently a young person came up to me and said she was sick of politicians standing in the way of her dreams. As if we were actually going to let Malia go to Burning Man this year. Was not going to happen. Bernie might have let her go. Not us.  I am hurt though, Bernie, that you have been distancing yourself a little from me. I mean that's just not something that you do to your comrade.  Bernie's slogan has helped his campaign catch fire among young people. 'Feel the Bern.' 'Feel the Bern.' That's a good slogan. Hillary's slogan has not had the same effect. Let's see this.   Look, I've said how much I admire Hillary's toughness, her smarts, her policy chops, her experience. You've got admit it though, Hillary trying appeal to young voters is a little bit like your relative who just signed up for Facebook. 'Dear America, did you get my poke? Is it appearing on your wall? I'm not sure I'm using this right. Love, Aunt Hillary.' It's not entirely persuasive.  Meanwhile, on the Republican side, things are a little more, how shall we say this, a little more loose. Just look at the confusion over the invitations to tonight's dinner. Guests were asked to check whether they wanted steak or fish. But instead, a whole bunch of you wrote in Paul Ryan. That's not an option, people. Steak or fish. You may not like steak or fish, but that's your choice.  Meanwhile, some candidates aren't polling high enough to qualify for their own joke tonight. . The rules were well established ahead of time.  And then there's Ted Cruz. Ted had a tough week. He went to Indiana. Hoosier country. Stood on a basketball court and called the hoop a basketball ring. What else is in his lexicon? Baseball sticks? Football hats? But sure, I'm the foreign one.  Well let me conclude tonight on a more serious note. I want thank the Washington press corps. I want to thank Carol for all that you do. The free press is central to our democracy and, nah, I'm just kidding! You know I'm going to talk about Trump! Come on. We weren't just going to stop there. Come on.  Although I am a little hurt that he's not here tonight. We had so much fun that last time, And it is surprising. You've got a room full of reporters, celebrities, cameras. And he says no. Is this dinner too tacky for the Donald? What could he possibly be doing instead? Is he at home eating a Trump steak, tweeting out insults to Angela Merkel? What's he doin'?  The Republican establishment is incredulous that he is their most likely nominee. Incredulous. Shocking. They say Donald lacks the foreign policy experience to be president. But in fairness, he has spent years meeting with leaders from around the world: Miss Sweden, Miss Argentina, Miss Azerbaijan. And there is one area where Donald's experience could be invaluable, and that's closing Guantanamo because Trump knows a thing or two about running waterfront properties into the ground. Alright, that is probably enough. I mean I've got more material. No, no, no. I don't want to spend too much time on The Donald. Following your lead, I want to show some restraint. Because I think we can all agree that from the start he's gotten the appropriate amount of coverage befitting the seriousness of his candidacy. Ha. I hope you all are proud of yourselves. The guy wanted to give his hotel business a boost and now we are praying that Cleveland makes it through July. Mmm mmm mmn. Hmmm.  As for me and Michelle, we've decided to stay in D.C. for a couple more years. Thank you. This way our youngest daughter can finish up high school. Michelle can stay closer to her plot of carrots. She's already making plans to see them every day. Take a look .  But our decision has actually presented a bit of a dilemma because traditionally presidents don't stick around after they're done. And it's something that I've been brooding about a little bit. Take a look...  There you go. I am still waiting for all of you to respond to my invitation to connect to LinkedIn. But I know you have jobs to do which is what really brings us here tonight.  I know that there are times that we've had differences and that's inherent in our institutional roles. That is true of every president and his press corps. But we've always shared the same goal to root our public discourse in the truth. To open the doors of this democracy. To do whatever we can to make our country and our world more free and more just.  And I've always appreciated the role that you have all played as equal partners in reaching these goals. Our free press is why we once again recognize the real journalists who uncover the horrifying scandal and brought some measure of justice for thousands of victims around the world. They are here with us tonight: Sacha Pfeiffer, Mike Rezendes, Walter Robinson, Matt Caroll and Ben Bradlee Jr. Please give them a big round of applause.  A free press is why, once again, we honor Jason Rezaian, as Carol noted. Last time this year we spoke of Jason's courage as he endured the isolation of an Iranian prison. This year we see that courage in the flesh, and it's a living testament to the very idea of a free press and a reminder of the rising level of danger and political intimidation and the physical threats faced by reporters overseas.  And I can make this commitment that as long as I hold this office my administration will continue to fight for the release of American journalists held against their will. And we will not stop until they see the same freedom as Jason had.  At home and abroad journalists like all of you engage in the dogged pursuit of informing citizens and holding leaders accountable, and making our government of the people possible. And it's an enormous responsibility. And I realize it's an enormous challenge at a time when the economics of the business sometimes incentivizes speed over depth, and when controversy and conflict are what most immediately attract readers and viewers. The good news is there are so many of you that are pushing against those trends and as a citizen of this great democracy, I am grateful for that.  For this is also a time around the world when some of the fundamental ideals of liberal democracies are under attack and when notions of objectively and of a free press and of facts and of evidence are trying to be undermined or in some cases ignored entirely. And in such a climate it's not enough just to give people a megaphone. And that's why your power and your responsibility to dig and to question and to counter distortions and untruths is more important than even ever.  Taking a stand on behalf of what is true does not require you shedding your objectivity. In fact, it is the essence of good journalism. It affirms the idea that the only way we can build consensus, the only way that we can move forward as a country, the only way we can help the world mend itself is by agreeing on a baseline of facts when it comes to the challenges that confront us all. So this night is a testament to all of you who have devoted your lives to that idea, who push to shine a light on the truth every single day. So, I want to close my final White House correspondents' dinner by just saying thank you. I'm very proud of what you've done. It has been an honor and a privilege to work side by side with you to strengthen our democracy. With that I just have two more words to say: Obama out. .6",

        "#11 Rhye - Woman   The first time we heard Rhye was when they released their stunning single Open. Every person who heard this track thought of Sade. You're a liar if you didn't. Who is this girl with this deep velvety voice? everyone asked. Except we would come to find out  that this wasn't a woman singing at all, but rather Canadian singer Mike Milosh. Rhye's producer is Danish-born Robin Hannibal and together they created a remarkable album of sensual grooves and love songsWoman begins with the aforementioned Open and if it wasn't clear that this is an album you make love to, just watch the video for Open. But it's the album's 2nd song, The Fall that lingers with you long after it's stopped playing. As Hannibal's piano hovers alongside a jazz drum beat and string arrangement while Milosh sings:The song is gone It fell into the fall But I don't want it this way Why can't you stay?The recurring theme of the album is set forth; that of maintaining the strength of your relationship when your life is constantly on the move. Not just any relationship, but the one... yearning for a love  so deeply rooted that it inspires the authenticity of the passionate expression we're graced with. Most of these songs were written by Milosh to his now-wife and there is no lack of passion on this record like on the album's crown jewel, 3 Days:Oh, I'm famished So I'll eat your minerals Like a rabid beast at a foolish feast I'll steal your breathWhen I think of the lyrics on this album the first line that comes to mind is so I'll eat your minerals. It perfectly describes the nature of the sexual human beast. It's running your hands down your lover's naked body like an animal. We all have these carnal passions in us and Milosh lays it down here like no other. Think of the rhythm of the action described within the rhythm of the beat. The first effect we hear sounds like a sputtering trumpet punctuating for 5 beats and the 6th beat in the measure is the piano. This is some jazzy stuff  I could sit here and break down more of the music and lyrics, but this album NEEDS to be experienced. You have to hear the horn samples. You HAVE to be left in amazement of his nearly impossible voice. You HAVE to think about how much the opening to Shed Some Blood is reminiscent of Air's Universal Traveller. You HAVE to yearn for Sade's classic LP  Promise, cause nothing has come this close to her sound before. Woman is in the same breath as great sensual albums of our time like D'Angelo's Voodoo and Frank Ocean's Channel Orange. Do what you will with this information and thank me later.

        "River of Tears  It's three miles to the river That would carry me away And two miles to the dusty street That I saw you on today It's four miles to my lonely room Where I'm going to hide my face And about half a mile to the downtown bar That I ran from in disgrace   Lord, how long have I got to keep on running? Seven hours, seven days or seven years? All I know is, since you've been gone Feel like I'm drowning in a river Drowning in a river of tears Drowning in a river Feel like I'm drowning Drowning in a river   In three more days, I'll leave this town And disappear without a trace A year from now, maybe settle down Where no one knows my face I wish that I could hold you One more time to ease the pain But my time's run out and I got to go Got to run away again  Still I catch myself thinking One day I'll find my way back here You'll save me from drowning Drowning in a river Drowning in a river of tears Drowning in a river Feel like I'm drowning Drowning in a river Lord, how long must it go on?  Drowning Drowning Drowning in a river of tears2",
        "Of This Land How gentle was the breeze that surrounded the way How loud the sea's roar on the four winds everyday Sharing love, wounded gifts from ancient long ago Together they closed in the circles we know  Will we treasure all the secrets with life's changing scenes? Where our hearts were warm with love, so much love Will the flowers grow again as I open out my hand? Precious time, time for healing the beauty of this land   How soulful those words that confuses the way How wild the mountains' stare as they guard our every day Take for granted noble hearts in the golden age that's flown Between us, recall on a strong road we've known  Will we treasure all the secrets with life's changing scenes? Where our hearts were warm with love, so much love Will the flowers grow again as I open out my hand? Precious time, time for healing the beauty of this land",
        "Happy Sadness had been close as my next of kin Then Happy came one day, chased my blues away My life began when Happy smiled Sweet, like candy to a child Stay here and love me just a while Let sadness see what Happy does Let Happy be where Sadness was  Happy, that's you You made my life brand new Lost as a little lam was I till you came in My life began when Happy smiled Sweet, like candy to a child Stay here and love me just a while Let sadness see what Happy does Let Happy be where Sadness was   Where have I been? What lifetime was I in? Suspended between time and space Lonely until Happy came smiling up at me Sadness had no choice but to flee I said a prayer so silently Let Sadness see what Happy does Let Happy be where Sadness was till now",

The troubles of the day Took my breath away Took my breath away  Now you're no longer talking And I'm no longing hearing There's nothing left to say Said it anyway Said it anyway  And I want you not I need you not I'm dying 'cause this is the saddest song I've got The saddest song I've got  Darling are you healing From all those scars appearing? And don't it hurt a lot? Don't know how to stop Don't know how it stops  Now there's no sense in seeing The colors of the morning Can't hold the clouds at bay Chase them all away Chase them all away And I'm frozen still Unspoken still Hearts broken Remembering something I forgot Something I forgot",
        "Dust 2... If dust could only talk What would we hear it say? Before it's brushed aside Just as it's swept away  It's just the evidence It's of no consequence It's only flesh and bone Why don't you leave it alone?  If dust could only speak Caught in a falling beam If dust could only cry If dust could only scream For it's the single witness that might testify Could I spit out the truth? Or would you rather just swallow a lie?  But dust is always caught behind a coat of paint Beneath the marble fingernails of kings and saints And in the theatre curtain where they hang a drape Or in the ticket pocket where your hands escape  Before they start to wander Or they start to shrink You rub your eye a little and appear to blink And then she caught you staring She knows just what you're thinking What got into you was not a ghost as such It was just dust Here comes the juggernaut Here come The Poisoners They choke the life and land And rob the joy from us Why do they taste of sugar Oh, when they're made of money Here comes the lamb of God And the butcher's boy, Sonny  Well I believe we just Become a speck of dust...",

        "Storm in a Teacup I'm just saying I want my mummy back Lost her to the drink but her soul's intact Mama said to me be proud of who you are She saw Jesus in the eyes of a broken man  Sail away, I am learning my lesson Mama sends her love and Godspeed you come home One little white lie was enough to conceal my goodbye Then I stole away Kissed her farewell and wished her the best for her life Then I stole away like a thief in the night  I'm just saying not behind daddy's back He takes care of her in his overtime He's no saint I know as he goes around the town Watch him cry himself to sleep, he's my daddy  Sail away, I will go it alone now Leave my past behind to seek fortune and fame Sail away, there's a storm in a teacup Mama sends her love and Godspeed you come home One little white lie was enough to conceal my goodbye Then I stole away Kissed her farewell and wished her the best for her life Then I stole away woah like a thief in the night One little white lie was enough to conceal my goodbye Then I stole away Like a prodigal son and wished her the best for her life Then I stole away woah like a thief in the night",
        "What Child Is This? What child is this who laid to rest On Mary's lap is sleeping Whom angels greet with anthems sweet While shepherds watch are keeping  This, this is Christ the King Whom shepherds guard And angels sing Haste, haste to bring him laud The babe, the son of Mary  Raise, raise the song on high The Virgin sings her lullaby Joy, joy for Christ is born The babe, the son of Mary",

Yeah, like Jazz Royalty Oh, you mean Duke Ellington and Count Bassie What about the great horn players? Louis Armstrong, yeah, and Miles and Dizzy too Don't forget Snookie What about Yarnburn? What, don't you mean Charlie Parker? Yeah, this cool named Freddy Hubert A little jazz is just a little bit of this and that Sometimes we sing, sometimes we play, sometimes we scat But most of all it's how you feel about the groove And when it's grovin', how the groove makes you move",

They say Hell hath no furies Like a woman scorned by life When the Heavenly Judge and juries Participate to chain this wife With forced virtue, Her secret needs On warm we nights, with storm-wracked bites I gave her Eden after the flood  Written in the dead of night And riding on the burning wind Smitten by her read delight My words alight like leaves of sin Verona, Marishka, Aleera Brides of old and goddesses all Forgive my wishes to be always near her Forever or whenever seas recall  The Aphrodite from my embrace For as Mars  I tore these shores with wars of hatred Before our Paris wet his fate In Helen, one might find mistake In winning tragedy For all eternity...

Four call outs, five call outs, I'm gettin' up from the lunch table But first, a history lesson Your name was Triple C until you ever heard of me And then you changed it to Ch-Rone two months after I hit the scene And while that might all seem above board, Travis Imagine a battle rapper came out named Ch-Organik I would probably bother you, but I always show Buddy Love Just clumped  him with the rest, never let push come to shove But somehow, you turned into this little brother to me Who'd always want to compete Who'd always tug at my sleeve The bother, the little toddler, the fly buzzing at me Food stuck in my teeth, the tag under my tee The terrible combination of awkward and cocky Chronically sloppy, sonically off beat Every single day you should curse God for your body Your cringe worthy demeanor his this tailored for the perfect take down But the second hand awkwardness of sharing the stage with you made me want to turn the plate down We watched you grow up from a boy, you have a perverts face now Any character assassination would be a nervous breakdown Yo, your eye's movin', how he's quivering like it's puberty that crippled him He's a wet noodle, a drenched poodle, a drooping piece of licorice From your shoulders to your arms, how you move them like an idiot If we were judging off body language, bro you would be illiterate But his karate action arms, that's his true talent Throw him some melons while he's rappin' he'll make a fruit salad But I'm not here to make an impression of you, I'm here to make an impression on you To prove that none of your family matters, don't your uncle or auntie  matter I'm unstable, I'm Billy Idol minus the Stratocaster I'll put a foreigner through the rafters, I'm the coroner for these rappers It's a champ versus a stepping stool, I'm the former you're the latter  Bro, you always wanted my chains, well today we can fulfill that You never have to win a title, I'll leave you permanently stilled champ See, I am offended at any list where your name is ranked ahead of me I am resentful of anyone that puts you in the same breath as me The only chance you'd ever be ranked ahead of me is alphabetically, so thank the letter C It's gon' be agony like you were at Gethsemane You should be banned indefinitely like Randy Gregory I'm here to get under your skin like an appendectomy or Patrick Beverley Bro you have the personality of a patch of celery You should've been an abandoned pregnancy You misunderstood your girl's Tinder bio when she said she wanted to be challenged mentally He's been chasin' me for so long, it's really got me in a whirlwind It's got me wonderin', who's really your white whale?

You've used battle rap since day one, this is where we both got our fame from If I'm battling in 2029, pat me on the back like, thanks for remembering where you came from. You got nice flow but no punching skill Ten years I'm punching still The Philly Prince Will get sonned in Cali I'm Uncle Phil Slashed throat They put his face on a shirt, RIP the Frat GOAT This time when you go viral on a tee  it ain't for fat jokes You handpick opportunities it's see through 'Ganik didn't even say your name and I knew it'd be you I just said I think I'll win and he wrote #metoo I'm your executioner, Lucifer shut the fuck up Your time is fading Rone, who you annihilating? You look like all five people that died from vaping You callin' out Mike P? Dawg that's light Bring him to the SMACK Killer we are not alike I'll treat him like the show you got fired from and Drop The Mic I got a violent left; ANTIFA You getting floored this time, fuck a metaphor or rhyme The right will have him higher than our credit scores combined While you were doing keg stands grabbin' your friends erection I beat you in a freestyle battle with less aggression Listen Rone this ain't beer pong you won't get redemption The frat killer, tell Brad, Thad and Chad that this verse is amazing You can't fuck with the GOAT this ain't fraternity hazing How many IPA's have you tried today? Your parents got the job done My sweet 16: Not fun What you know 'bout asking your dad for two Mercedes and you got one? This ain't for the news fans that just want us to hold lead Code red Connor Mcgregor this for the old heads Rone you ain't nothing but a fuckin' cokehead Waitin' for someone to have a bump for him like an old thread I got all kinds of tablets I can supply this addict So much speed Al Davis tried to draft it Have him snortin' 'til he feel ill Coke so white Method Man assumed it voted for Real Deal He gon' make this Barstool vs Wild N' Out and that's a fact I mean I don't care and you claimin' I don't clap a gat Bring up Timothy De La Ghetto cause he's got the man purse, that just means my man is strapped Who from Barstool is here to support you? I mean, well that guy's wack Your friends aren't in your corner and that's a fact No matter how much you ignore this, you will always be welcomed in battle rap One day you'll be fired from your job and that's a fact Don't be surprised cause a Barstool never has your back Time!   Imagine being a grown man, Charron fan You talk about Bodied like it's Rocky, the delusion is astounding It's budget was $15,000,000 and it grossed $100,000 And you had what? Two more lines than me? Shit ain't never been funny Congratulations, you had a bigger part in losing Eminem's money But while we were shooting Bodied you were drinkin' in the lobby In the Standard in Los Angeles, you were gettin' sloppy You started mouthing off to Pat Stay I thought, This won't go well. And sure enough, he bitch slapped you in front of the whole hotel And I don't wanna misconstrue it, you got slapped and your lip was drooling You would've thought that he dropped this fruit from the way that this bitch was bruising That's why we laugh when you talk tough like, Who does he think he's fooling? You almost died off that smack in an L.A. hotel we would've thought it was Whitney Houston You were a terrible drunk and he smacked you in the Standard So K-Shine's not an outlier, smacking you is the standard I mean Aye Verb stepped to you, Shotgun peppered you Bonnie almost broke her fuckin' wrist dick checkin' you Shine made a mess of you, Pat disrespected you Ars' had his hands on your face like he was blessin' you So who the fuck are you playin' with? You've already been 86'd I don't mean they cancelled you, I mean number of hands on you if they dusted your face for prints Why does that always happen to you? Why does that never happen to me? It's not happenstance that they slot you fam', that's just who you happen to be But you embrace the school shooter image like you think that shit is powerful 'Til I lift you up and beat the fucking warning signs outta you Bro this one's a camcorder, it'll help deliver the picture This one's a transformer it'll turn him into a sprinter Your dad's a mechanic from Orleans, well I had to have a talk with him It's funny he works at Midas, and you got a touch of Autism But you take pride in Wild N' Out when it's legitimately terrible 15 straight years of the same Mariah Carey joke Word to Nick Cannon's turban, I've been offered Wild N' Out six times, there's written record of that Six times, ain't that the amount of seasons that you've been in the cast? Bro, from Wild N' Out to Drop The Mic to battles in this league They'll only ever call you when they can't book me The name brand versus the budget version Undeserving, less funny person The first choice that they cater too versus the back up, the safety school The option is less sexy when they can't sign Gretzky The Chrysler 300 they rent when they can't afford the Bentley Bro, all of Viacom loves me, they would kill to write a check They'd have a pilot waitin' on me like a fuckin' private jet Yo, you sound like you're high on helium, the show is the height of tedium This skinny little geek is tryin' to make it on TV, that's a dying medium But before I retire his ass like Andrew Luck Let's talk about that time Organik watched some groupie bitch and you fuck You went soft but tried to keep going cause the audience had you rattled Isn't it bad enough he had to watch you pretend to be hard in your battles? Bro, you love to go on SMACK to brag on the fake crack you slang And gats you bang If it were up to you, you'd be on a Banned  every month like Andrew Yang But what about that time you said, Mexicans can't be super heroes cause quote They're too lazy bro But what's really lazy though? The accent? The basic quotes The fact that you were hitting a Dominican with racist tropes that aren't even creative jokes? I mean, Corey Charron, hates the Mexicans more than the Border Patrol He's not callin' shots, he's callin' cops to a foreigner's home He'll cock his gun he hears someone say senor on the phone Well the coroner's home, put four in his dome Get beat to death, leave the flesh around your cornea swole This an orchestra, what you pen is boring and slow Past your expiration date, baby wait your formula's old You go the wrong way at every single fork in the road I'll leave your body stretched out like the warrior pose Out of all of battle rap, I got the corniest clone You hate Mexicans? Then get the fuck out California bro! Bro, I'm a mix of Rambo and Tony Soprano I'll tag your man's toe like I was Virgil Abloh You're off white thinking you got the best answer Unless there's something you want to get off your chest after like breast cancer Cause at the negotiating table, you're softer than Ned Flanders You're not scoring, Travi$ Scott's Jordan's your check's backwards Bro you said- I got a million ways kill him, but if none of all that work I'll just drop him off in east Oakland in his confederate flag shirt Bro you could never match my moves in or out the ring Call me Roney Bae The Prince but to you I'll always be the king   He callin' me racist but... They say Head ICE robbed you, your third round was light If you couldn't make it out of Harlem how did my dad make it out of Harlem? Because he's white Like, was that a third round or a Third Reich? I'm no B. Dot, I'm not an expert on this situation And this coming from someone that accused B.E.T. of discrimination But between your dad and Head ICE, who struggled in life more? You said, It's not your fault if your born poor but it is if you die poor. That's what your physicist dad taught you while he set up your trust fund? Due to his skin, which Harlem cops did he run from? Which neighborhoods, which schools was he shunned from? That mentality is the same reason that Trump won You said, my dad was racist about the Mexicans, but c'mon son It's not your fault if you're born to a racist but it is if you become one Also, against Head ICE you also said, You're tethered to an existence that doesn't mean shit to me While I was taking trips to Sicily You were in self imposed poverty figuring out what kid to feed Cringe The epitome You act black, now look inwardly  Predatory lending, they couldn't get help yet They were designated to hoods they couldn't get out yet This motherfucker thought redlining was a Microsoft spell check Only people on 4chan like how you rap Your favorite chore is laundry day, so you can separate the whites from the blacks You spit those bars in Toronto in front of a bunch of crackers I dare you to come to Cali and say All Lives fucking Matter You know how many Trump supporters are here? One: Dizaster Aye, I did wear the confederate flag sleeve I accept all the scrutiny I acted foolishly Apologize- I didn't know the history and apologized to the community We move as a unit Why? Because of unity Yesterday I was called out for appropriation, today you won't hear an Ooops from me This ain't even a battle, this is a eulogy That's why shhh Rone, cause when I look at you it's a moment of silence for who I used to be You brag about your vaca's like Look at my big trips. You make 100K, you think MTV is how I get rich? Air B&B, HVAC that's the right business You get Bud Light I sip Cris' Knock over his Barstool, you ain't Wild N' Out like this bitch Last year 700K those are my digits You'd have to save up 7 years pay to get my interest Two apps, get paid when the site gets hits I inspire kids with Autism plus my girl has nice big tits Listen Rone I ain't the one to talk that I'm winning at life shit with You tried to stunt on Head ICE, dawg relax Bring up my Autism I have retarded stacks If I wake up feeling like a million bucks the market crashed A millionaire at 25 how can the prince be proud? After this quick beat down You can battle my pockets and spit your Big T rounds I don't watch Barstool I put that on the Bible I'd rather swallow crack before my Morgan's piano recital Or watch another Chilla/Trevor rematch for the title You got at The Saurus for gambling, you bet on sports games all the time So I made my own odds on the ways that you'll die A trillion to one? You died from your fans getting trampled in the streets 1,000 to 1? You OD'd after your motherfuckin' panics increased 10 to 1? You'll develop AIDS from Sandusky's beef Or 1 to 1: You die of shame after admitting you got raped once this battle's released This is karma for all your rounds I mean, you're not Big T fat, but you put on some pounds You quit battling for a podcast you're basically Okwerdz now You only hit up Ganik when he's got something to offer you You look like a bird and flock like a vulture Your dad's a physicist and he need you Adam  cause you make up everything that's wrong with this culture So fuck your mother, fuck your brother I hope your step mom dies Fuck every Ben Shapiro speech on your desktop drive Fuck Barstools segments on The Best Pop Flies You make podcasts for white kids that drop the N bomb on X-Box Live Fuck you for not knowing what your privilege does Fuck the Barstool founder for calling all women Sluts Fuck you for laughing at it with your buds Fuck you for promoting a rape culture that you're a victim of Fuck Joseph Kahn for giving you a pity role and 100's of bucks After you got rejected for the role of Adam cause you weren't funny enough Fuck your character in Bodied you wouldn't engage to a thing How can you propose? For two years you stayed away from the ring Fuck your for not leading as an example Fuck you for not giving a shot to those trapped in your shadow You're from Philly, so fuck you for the last two Cassidy battles Fuck you for thinking King Of The Dot isn't the place for you Fuck you for only showing up to a SMACK event, look what you made me do And fuck the URL for last night when they hacked our PPV! I mean, people wanna go against Rone but watch how I rhyme first He wants to do this he's diggin' up dirt Well watch how he goes in his guy's hearse He says I hate Spanish people, I mean is that how your mind works? He also said Organik watched me fuck a bitch, I'll show him how the dime hurts You're right, he was watching while I had a tag team with Myverse You're an ungrateful hypocrite the truth's gotta sting I am more successful then you and I'm still doing my thing So Trevor, it's time for me to see you in the ring It's Charoney baby the prince and soon to be king Let's get it   Bro I always knew he had a side hustle, poppin' fly shit in The Bay I always assumed he worked for Uber cause he always drives women away But you love to talk about this money and never tell us where you got it Turns out you were a door to door energy salesman who just ran old people's pockets You were scamming their life away and then treating it like a game And because of your lying ways they were broke in their dying days Well try that shit with my grandma, find out if she's really with the shit She'd be off the porch like Clint Eastwood, we'd see Billy Pistol whipped Bro, being part of a pyramid scheme makes you a sucker regardless But scamming old people? I give a fuck if you're Autistic That shit is retarded Bro, scamming the senile, old folks losing their memory The irony, you taking advantage of people who aren't all there mentally Well I bet you wish you were back selling gas facing the elderly instead of me Cause I'll give you the option that you didn't Let's see if you keep that same energy Yo I'll get your girlfriend dog, when she comes through the east Bay And I'll pay Michael Vick to abuse it each day I'll bring it right up in her room, if she refuse the BJ I'll beat it right in front of her like Louis C.K See it could get real eventful if I use the steel against you You catch six from the tre , that's a Philly special I'll Philly Pretzel Billy Pistolz, he'll be lookin' like Whoopi's braids But if I really pistol Billy Pistolz he'll be lookin' like Billy Mays So you're saying that Autism shit's real though? Oow that's mean Bet you wish you listened to Hollow and skipped the flu vaccine But I love my people with Autism unconditionally, best believe it But for you to bring it up in a title match for sympathy and expect other people not to talk about it, almost seems like you're askin' for special treatment See I'm here to dig a hole for you, soul remove and lower you And just cause you have Autism don't mean I'll take it slow for you I'll whip your ass like anyone else Cause that's what I'm supposed to do But it's a shame you don't understand social queues cause you have no idea how bad I'm owning you I've read up on non-verbal learning disorder as some insight on your brain for me It said you can read a civil war book, remember every general's name but not realize it's about slavery And that explained to me why your concepts can't hit and each angle's a bad miss Because other than General Lee  you really don't understand shit I kept reading, and I almost felt bad for the geek But the deeper I got, what did I happen to see? It helps you focus on a task, you are the man with your frees It helps you access rhymes, you are fast on your feet You're less likely to be insulted that helps you battle with ease It compartmentalizes thoughts, all your facts and your schemes So by the time I finished reading I was mad as can be Until I realized the one that's really disadvantaged...is me I mean, do you know how hard it is to be a battle rapper Without Autism? Who's done a drug, a beer, who's really got bitches? I started scheming, vaccineing, you don't know how bad I want the shit The more I'm reading, I can't believe it, it's like everybody's got the shit Fucking Steve Jobs, Dickenson, Einstein, Newton, Bill Gates, Burton, Mozart, Darwin And wouldn't it be crazy if someone like Jobs went on stage with a sob story instead of making the iPod? If Einstein was woe is me instead of finding Relativity If Newton never understood his own gift's gravity? If Mozart never played strings and curled up in a ball If Darwin had played the victim and had never evolved See that's my problem with your scamming shit It isn't moralism It doesn't matter how rich you are if you're still making poor decisions You're a scumbag from your actions, no one's exploiting you Being Autistic doesn't make you any less of a man, dawg, but your choices do See I'm up front, you're sidewinding I'm a lone wolf, you're hive minded I'm obsessed with originality, you're the most derivative on the battle scene You have the charm of Rush Limbaugh, women love me, you make their skin crawl I'm good at everything, you find your second talent then show me You're a punk bitch, fuck stick, one trick pony And those that pay attention are never gon' respect him It has nothing to do with Autism we're just on different ends of the spectrum And he could never match my moves either in or out the ring They call me Roney Bae The Prince but to you I'll always be the king!",

They won't try. They're lazy! They're unreliable! They're impudent and they leave without notice. They all want to be lawyers and doctors and  ladies!  God forbid! I answered solemnly, and then being of gentle birth, and unminded to strike a defenseless female of uncertain years, I ran; I ran home and wrote a chapter in my book and this is it.  I speak and speak bitterly as a servant and a servant's son, for my mother spent five or more years of her life as a menial; my father's family escaped, although grandfather as a boat steward had to fight hard to be a man and not a lackey. He fought and won. My mother's folk, however, during my childhood, sat poised on that thin edge between the farmer and the menial. The surrounding Irish had two chances, the factory and the kitchen, and most of them took the factory, with all its dirt and noise and low wage. The factory was closed to us. Our little lands were too small to feed most of us. A few clung almost sullenly to the old homes, low and red things crouching on a wide level; but the children stirred restlessly and walked often to town and saw its wonders. Slowly they dribbled off,--a waiter here, a cook there, help for a few weeks in Mrs. Blank's kitchen when she had summer boarders.  Instinctively I hated such work from my birth. I loathed it and shrank from it. Why? I could not have said. Had I been born in Carolina instead of Massachusetts I should hardly have escaped the taint of service. Its temptations in wage and comfort would soon have answered my scruples; and yet I am sure I would have fought long even in Carolina, for I knew in my heart that thither lay Hell.  I mowed lawns on contract, did chores that left me my own man, sold papers, and peddled tea--anything to escape the shadow of the awful thing that lurked to grip my soul. Once, and once only, I felt the sting of its talons. I was twenty and had graduated from Fisk with a scholarship for Harvard; I needed, however, travel money and clothes and a bit to live on until the scholarship was due. Fortson was a fellow-student in winter and a waiter in summer. He proposed that the Glee Club Quartet of Fisk spend the summer at the hotel in Minnesota where he worked and that I go along as Business Manager to arrange for engagements on the journey back. We were all eager, but we knew nothing of table-waiting. Never mind, said Fortson, you can stand around the dining-room during meals and carry out the big wooden trays of dirty dishes. Thus you can pick up knowledge of waiting and earn good tips and get free board. I listened askance, but I went.  I entered that broad and blatant hotel at Lake Minnetonka with distinct forebodings. The flamboyant architecture, the great verandas, rich furniture, and richer dresses awed us mightily. The long loft reserved for us, with its clean little cots, was reassuring; the work was not difficult,--but the meals! There were no meals. At first, before the guests ate, a dirty table in the kitchen was hastily strewn with uneatable scraps. We novices were the only ones who came to eat, while the guests' dining-room, with its savors and sights, set our appetites on edge! After a while even the pretense of meals for us was dropped. We were sure we were going to starve when Dug, one of us, made a startling discovery: the waiters stole their food and they stole the best. We gulped and hesitated. Then we stole, too,  and we all fattened, for the dainties were marvelous. You slipped a bit here and hid it there; you cut off extra portions and gave false orders; you dashed off into darkness and hid in corners and ate and ate! It was nasty business. I hated it. I was too cowardly to steal much myself, and not coward enough to refuse what others stole.  Our work was easy, but insipid. We stood about and watched overdressed people gorge. For the most part we were treated like furniture and were supposed to act the wooden part. I watched the waiters even more than the guests. I saw that it paid to amuse and to cringe. One particular black man set me crazy. He was intelligent and deft, but one day I caught sight of his face as he served a crowd of men; he was playing the clown,--crouching, grinning, assuming a broad dialect when he usually spoke good English--ah! it was a heartbreaking sight, and he made more money than any waiter in the dining-room.  I did not mind the actual work or the kind of work, but it was the dishonesty and deception, the flattery and cajolery, the unnatural assumption that worker and diner had no common humanity. It was uncanny. It was inherently and fundamentally wrong. I stood staring and thinking, while the other boys hustled about. Then I noticed one fat hog, feeding at a heavily gilded trough, who could not find his waiter. He beckoned me. It was not his voice, for his mouth was too full. It was his way, his air, his assumption. Thus Caesar ordered his legionaries or Cleopatra her slaves. Dogs recognized the gesture. I did not. He may be beckoning yet for all I know, for something froze within me. I did not look his way again. Then and there I disowned menial service for me and my people.  I would work my hands off for an honest wage, but for tips and hand-me-outs, never! Fortson was a pious, honest fellow, who regarded tips as in the nature of things, being to the manner born; but the hotel that summer in other respects rather astonished even him. He came to us much flurried one night and got us to help him with a memorial to the absentee proprietor, telling of the wild and gay doings of midnights in the rooms and corridors among tired business men and their prostitutes. We listened wide-eyed and eager and wrote the filth out manfully. The proprietor did not thank Fortson. He did not even answer the letter.  When I finally walked out of that hotel and out of menial service forever, I felt as though, in a field of flowers, my nose had been held unpleasantly long to the worms and manure at their roots. Cursed be Canaan! cried the Hebrew priests. A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren. With what characteristic complacency did the slaveholders assume that Canaanites were Negroes and their brethren white? Are not Negroes servants? Ergo! Upon such spiritual myths was the anachronism of American slavery built, and this was the degradation that once made menial servants the aristocrats among colored folk. House servants secured some decencies of food and clothing and shelter; they could more easily reach their master's ear; their personal abilities of character became known and bonds grew between slave and master which strengthened from friendship to love, from mutual service to mutual blood.  Naturally out of this the West Indian servant climbed out of slavery into citizenship, for few West Indian masters--fewer Spanish or Dutch--were callous enough to sell their own children into slavery. Not so with English and Americans. With a harshness and indecency seldom paralleled in the civilized world white masters on the mainland sold their mulatto children, half-brothers and half-sisters, and their own wives in all but name, into life-slavery by the hundreds and thousands. They originated a special branch of slave-trading for this trade and the white aristocrats of Virginia and the Carolinas made more money by this business during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries than in any other way.  The clang of the door of opportunity thus knelled in the ears of the colored house servant whirled the whole face of Negro advancement as on some great pivot. The movement was slow, but vast. When emancipation came, before and after 1863, the house servant still held advantages. He had whatever education the race possessed and his white father, no longer able to sell him, often helped him with land and protection. Notwithstanding this the lure of house service for the Negro was gone. The path of salvation for the emancipated host of black folk lay no longer through the kitchen door, with its wide hall and pillared veranda and flowered yard beyond. It lay, as every Negro soon knew and knows, in escape from menial serfdom.  In 1860, 98 per cent of the Negroes were servants and serfs. In 1880, 30 per cent were servants and 65 per cent were serfs. The percentage of servants then rose slightly and fell again until 21 per cent were in service in 1910 and, doubtless, much less than 20 per cent today. This is the measure of our rise, but the Negro will not approach freedom until this hateful badge of slavery and mediaevalism has been reduced to less than 10 per cent.  Not only are less than a fifth of our workers servants today, but the character of their service has been changed. The million menial workers among us include 300,000 upper servants,--skilled men and women of character, like hotel waiters, Pullman porters, janitors, and cooks, who, had they been white, could have called on the great labor movement to lift their work out of slavery, to standardize their hours, to define their duties, and to substitute a living, regular wage for personal largess in the shape of tips, old clothes, and cold leavings of food. But the labor movement turned their backs on those black men when the white world dinned in their ears. Negroes are servants; servants are Negroes. They shut the door of escape to factory and trade in their fellows' faces and battened down the hatches, lest the 300,000 should be workers equal in pay and consideration with white men.  But, if the upper servants could not escape to modern, industrial conditions, how much the more did they press down on the bodies and souls of 700,000 washerwomen and household drudges,--ignorant, unskilled offal of a millionaire industrial system. Their pay was the lowest and their hours the longest of all workers. The personal degradation of their work is so great that any white man of decency would rather cut his daughter's throat than let her grow up to such a destiny. There is throughout the world and in all races no greater source of prostitution than this grade of menial service, and the Negro race in America has largely escaped this destiny simply because its innate decency leads black women to choose irregular and temporary sexual relations with men they like rather than to sell themselves to strangers. To such sexual morals is added  that revolt against unjust labor conditions which expresses itself in soldiering, sullenness, petty pilfering, unreliability, and fast and fruitless changes of masters.  Indeed, here among American Negroes we have exemplified the last and worst refuge of industrial caste. Menial service is an anachronism,--the refuse of mediaeval barbarism. Whey, then, does it linger? Why are we silent about it? Why in the minds of so many decent and up-seeing folks does the whole Negro problem resolve itself into the matter of their getting a cook or a maid?  No one knows better than I the capabilities of a system of domestic service at its best. I have seen children who were spiritual sons and daughters of their masters, girls who were friends of their mistresses, and old servants honored and revered. But in every such case the Servant had transcended the Menial, the Service had been exalted above the Wage. Now to accomplish this permanently and universally, calls for the same revolution in household help as in factory help and public service. While organized industry has been slowly making its help into self-respecting, well-paid men, and while public service is beginning to call for the highest types of educated and efficient thinkers, domestic service lags behind and insists upon seeking to evolve the best types of men from the worst conditions.  The cause of this perversity, to my mind, is twofold. First, the ancient high estate of Service, now pitifully fallen, yet gasping for breath; secondly, the present low estate of the outcasts of the world, peering with blood-shot eyes at the gates of the industrial heaven.  The Master spoke no greater word than that which said: Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your servant! What is greater than Personal Service! Surely no social service, no wholesale helping of masses of men can exist which does not find its effectiveness and beauty in the personal aid of man to man. It is the purest and holiest of duties. Some mighty glimmer of this truth survived in those who made the First Gentlemen of the Bedchamber, the Keepers of the Robes, and the Knights of the Bath, the highest nobility that hedged an anointed king. Nor does it differ today in what the mother does for the child or the daughter for the mother, in all the personal attentions in the old-fashioned home; this is Service! Think of what Friend has meant, not simply in spiritual sympathies, but in physical helpfulness. In the world today what calls for more of love, sympathy, learning, sacrifice, and long-suffering than the care of children, the preparation of food, the cleansing and ordering of the home, personal attendance and companionship, the care of bodies and their raiment--what greater, more intimate, more holy Services are there than these?  And yet we are degrading these services and loathing them and scoffing at them and spitting upon them, first, by turning them over to the lowest and least competent and worst trained classes in the world, and then by yelling like spoiled children if our babies are neglected, our biscuits sodden, our homes dirty, and our baths unpoured. Let one suggest that the only cure for such deeds is in the uplift of the doer and our rage is even worse and less explicable. We will call them by their first names, thus blaspheming a holy intimacy; we will confine them to back doors; we will insist that their meals be no gracious ceremony nor even a restful sprawl, but usually a hasty, heckled gulp amid garbage; we exact, not a natural, but a purchased deference, and we leave them naked to insult by our children and by our husbands.  I remember a girl,--how pretty she was, with the crimson flooding the old ivory of her cheeks and her gracious plumpness! She had come to the valley during the summer to do housework. I met and walked home with her, in the thrilling shadows, to an old village home I knew well; then as I turned to leave I learned that she was there alone in that house for a week-end with only one young white man to represent the family. Oh, he was doubtless a gentleman and all that, but for the first time in my life I saw what a snare the fowler was spreading at the feet of the daughters of my people, baited by church and state.  Not alone is the hurt thus offered to the lowly,--Society and Science suffer. The unit which we seek to make the center of society,--the Home--is deprived of the help of scientific invention and suggestion. It is only slowly and by the utmost effort that some small foothold has been gained for the vacuum cleaner, the washing-machine, the power tool, and the chemical reagent. In our frantic effort to preserve the last vestiges of slavery and mediaevalism we not only set out faces against such improvements, but we seek to use education and the power of the state to train the servants who do not naturally appear. Meantime the wild rush from house service, on the part of all who can scramble or run, continues. The rules of the labor union are designed, not simply to raise wages, but to guard against any likeness between artisan and servant. There is no essential difference in ability and training between a subway guard and a Pullman porter, but between their union cards lies a whole world.  Yet we are silent. Menial service is not a social problem. It is not really discussed. There is no scientific program for its reform. There is but one panacea: Escape! Get yourselves and your sons and daughters out of the shadow of this awful thing! Hire servants, but never be one. Indeed, subtly but surely the ability to hire at least a maid is still civilization's patent to respectability, while a man is the first word of aristocracy.  All this is because we still consciously and unconsciously hold to the manure theory of social organization. We believe that at the bottom of organized human life there are necessary duties and services which no real human being ought to be compelled to do. We push below this mudsill the derelicts and half-men, whom we hate and despise, and seek to build above it--Democracy! On such foundations is reared a Theory of Exclusiveness, a feeling that the world progresses by a process of excluding from the benefits of culture the majority of men, so that a gifted minority may blossom. Through this door the modern democrat arrives to the place where he is willing to allot two able-bodied men and two fine horses to the task of helping one wizened beldam to take the morning air.  Here the absurdity ends. Here all honest minds turn back and ask: Is menial service permanent or necessary? Can we not transfer cooking from the home to the scientific laboratory, along with the laundry? Cannot machinery, in the hands of self-respecting and well-paid artisans, do our cleaning, sewing, moving, and decorating? Cannot the training of children become an even greater profession than the attending of the sick? And cannot personal service and companionship be coupled with friendship and love where it belongs and whence it can never be divorced without degradation and pain?  In fine, can we not, black and white, rich and poor, look forward to a world of Service without Servants?  A miracle! you say? True. And only to be performed by the Immortal Child.  Jesus Christ in Texas  It was in Waco, Texas.  The convict guard laughed. I don't know, he said, I hadn't thought of that. He hesitated and looked at the stranger curiously. In the solemn twilight he got an impression of unusual height and soft, dark eyes. Curious sort of acquaintance for the colonel, he thought; then he continued aloud: But that nigger there is bad, a born thief, and ought to be sent up for life; got ten years last time--  Here the voice of the promoter, talking within, broke in; he was bending over his figures, sitting by the colonel. He was slight, with a sharp nose.  The convicts, he said, would cost us $96 a year and board. Well, we can squeeze this so that it won't be over $125 apiece. Now if these fellows are driven, they can build this line within twelve months. It will be running by next April. Freights will fall fifty per cent. Why, man, you'll be a millionaire in less than ten years.  The colonel started. He was a thick, short man, with a clean-shaven face and a certain air of breeding about the lines of his countenance; the word millionaire sounded well to his ears. He thought--he thought a great deal; he almost heard the puff of the fearfully costly automobile that was coming up the road, and he said:  I suppose we might as well hire them. Of course, answered the promoter.  The voice of the tall stranger in the corner broke in here:  It will be a good thing for them? he said, half in question.  The colonel moved. The guard makes strange friends, he thought to himself. What's this man doing here, anyway? He looked at him, or rather looked at his eyes, and then somehow he felt a warming toward him. He said:  Well, at least, it can't harm them; they're beyond that.  It will do them good, then, said the stranger again.  The promoter shrugged his shoulders. It will do us good, he said.  But the colonel shook his head impatiently. He felt a desire to justify himself before those eyes, and he answered: Yes, it will do them good; or at any rate it won't make them any worse than they are. Then he started to say something else, but here sure enough the sound of the automobile breathing at the gate stopped him and they all arose.  It is settled, then, said the promoter.  Yes, said the colonel, turning toward the stranger again. Are you going into town? he asked with the Southern courtesy of white men to white men in a country town. The stranger said he was. Then come along in my machine. I want to talk with you about this.  They went out to the car. The stranger as he went turned again to look back at the convict. He was a tall, powerfully built black fellow. His face was sullen, with a low forehead, thick, hanging lips, and bitter eyes. There was revolt written about his mouth despite the hang-dog expression. He stood bending over his pile of stones, pounding listlessly. Beside him stood a boy of twelve,--yellow, with a hunted, crafty look. The convict raised his eyes and they met the eyes of the stranger. The hammer fell from his hands.  The stranger turned slowly toward the automobile and the colonel introduced him. He had not exactly caught his name, but he mumbled something as he presented him to his wife and little girl, who were waiting.  As they whirled away the colonel started to talk, but the stranger had taken the little girl into his lap and together they conversed in low tones all the way home.  In some way, they did not exactly know how, they got the impression that the man was a teacher and, of course, he must be a foreigner. The long, cloak-like coat told this. They rode in the twilight through the lighted town and at last drew up before the colonel's mansion, with its ghost-like pillars.  The lady in the back seat was thinking of the guests she had invited to dinner and was wondering if she ought not to ask this man to stay. He seemed cultured and she supposed he was some acquaintance of the colonel's. It would be rather interesting to have him there, with the judge's wife and daughter and the rector. She spoke almost before she thought:  You will enter and rest awhile?  The colonel and the little girl insisted. For a moment the stranger seemed about to refuse. He said he had some business for his father, about town. Then for the child's sake he consented.  Up the steps they went and into the dark parlor where they sat and talked a long time. It was a curious conversation. Afterwards they did not remember exactly what was said and yet they all remembered a certain strange satisfaction in that long, low talk.  Finally the nurse came for the reluctant child and the hostess bethought herself:  We will have a cup of tea; you will be dry and tired.  She rang and switched on a blaze of light. With one accord they all looked at the stranger, for they had hardly seen him well in the glooming twilight. The woman started in amazement and the colonel half rose in anger. Why, the man was a mulatto, surely; even if he did not own the Negro blood, their practised eyes knew it. He was tall and straight and the coat looked like a Jewish gabardine. His hair hung in close curls far down the sides of his face and his face was olive, even yellow.  A peremptory order rose to the colonel's lips and froze there as he caught the stranger's eyes. Those eyes,--where had he seen those eyes before? He remembered them long years ago. The soft, tear-filled eyes of a brown girl. He remembered many things, and his face grew drawn and white. Those eyes kept burning into him, even when they were turned half away toward the staircase, where the white figure of the child hovered with her nurse and waved good-night. The lady sank into her chair and thought: What will the judge's wife say? How did the colonel come to invite this man here? How shall we be rid of him? She looked at the colonel in reproachful consternation.  Just then the door opened and the old butler came in. He was an ancient black man, with tufted white hair, and he held before him a large, silver tray filled with a china tea service. The stranger rose slowly and stretched forth his hands as if to bless the viands. The old man paused in bewilderment, tottered, and then with sudden gladness in his eyes dropped to his knees, and the tray crashed to the floor.  My Lord and my God! he whispered; but the woman screamed: Mother's china!  The doorbell rang.  Heavens! here is the dinner party! exclaimed the lady. She turned toward the door, but there in the hall, clad in her night clothes, was the little girl. She had stolen down the stairs to see the stranger again, and the nurse above was calling in vain. The woman felt hysterical and scolded at the nurse, but the stranger had stretched out his arms and with a glad cry the child nestled in them. They caught some words about the Kingdom of Heaven as he slowly mounted the stairs with his little, white burden.  The mother was glad of anything to get rid of the interloper, even for a moment. The bell rang again and she hastened toward the door, which the loitering black maid was just opening. She did not notice the shadow of the stranger as he came slowly down the stairs and paused by the newel post, dark and silent.  The judge's wife came in. She was an old woman, frilled and powdered into a semblance of youth, and gorgeously gowned. She came forward, smiling with extended hands, but when she was opposite the stranger, somewhere a chill seemed to strike her and she shuddered and cried:  What a draft! as she drew a silken shawl about her and shook hands cordially; she forgot to ask who the stranger was. The judge strode in unseeing, thinking of a puzzling case of theft.  Eh? What? Oh--er--yes,--good evening, he said, good evening. Behind them came a young woman in the glory of youth, and daintily silked, beautiful in face and form, with diamonds around her fair neck. She came in lightly, but stopped with a little gasp; then she laughed gaily and said:  Why, I beg your pardon. Was it not curious? I thought I saw there behind your man--she hesitated, but he must be a servant, she argued--the shadow of great, white wings. It was but the light on the drapery. What a turn it gave me. And she smiled again. With her came a tall, handsome, young naval officer. Hearing his lady refer to the servant, he hardly looked at him, but held his gilded cap carelessly toward him, and the stranger placed it carefully on the rack.  Last came the rector, a man of forty, and well-clothed. He started to pass the stranger, stopped, and looked at him inquiringly.  I beg your pardon, he said. I beg your pardon,--I think I have met you?  The stranger made no answer, and the hostess nervously hurried the guests on. But the rector lingered and looked perplexed.  Surely, I know you. I have met you somewhere, he said, putting his hand vaguely to his head. You--you remember me, do you not?  The stranger quietly swept his cloak aside, and to the hostess' unspeakable relief passed out of the door.  I never knew you, he said in low tones as he went.  The lady murmured some vain excuse about intruders, but the rector stood with annoyance written on his face.  I beg a thousand pardons, he said to the hostess absently. It is a great pleasure to be here,--somehow I thought I knew that man. I am sure I knew him once.  The stranger had passed down the steps, and as he passed, the nurse, lingering at the top of the staircase, flew down after him, caught his cloak, trembled, hesitated, and then kneeled in the dust.  He touched her lightly with his hand and said: Go, and sin no more!  With a glad cry the maid left the house, with its open door, and turned north, running. The stranger turned eastward into the night. As they parted a long, low howl rose tremulously and reverberated through the night. The colonel's wife within shuddered.  The bloodhounds! she said.  The rector answered carelessly:  Another one of those convicts escaped, I suppose. Really, they need severer measures. Then he stopped. He was trying to remember that stranger's name.  The judge's wife looked about for the draft and arranged her shawl. The girl glanced at the white drapery in the hall, but the young officer was bending over her and the fires of life burned in her veins.  Howl after howl rose in the night, swelled, and died away. The stranger strode rapidly along the highway and out into the deep forest. There he paused and stood waiting, tall and still.  A mile up the road behind a man was running, tall and powerful and black, with crime-stained face and convicts' stripes upon him, and shackles on his legs. He ran and jumped, in little, short steps, and his chains rang. He fell and rose again, while the howl of the hounds rang louder behind him.  Into the forest he leapt and crept and jumped and ran, streaming with sweat; seeing the tall form rise before him, he stopped suddenly, dropped his hands in sullen impotence, and sank panting to the earth. A greyhound shot out of the woods behind him, howled, whined, and fawned before the stranger's feet. Hound after hound bayed, leapt, and lay there; then silently, one by one, and with bowed heads, they crept backward toward the town.  The stranger made a cup of his hands and gave the man water to drink, bathed his hot head, and gently took the chains and irons from his feet. By and by the convict stood up. Day was dawning above the treetops. He looked into the stranger's face, and for a moment a gladness swept over the stains of his face.  Why, you are a nigger, too, he said.  Then the convict seemed anxious to justify himself.  I never had no chance, he said furtively.  Thou shalt not steal, said the stranger.  The man bridled.  But how about them? Can they steal? Didn't they steal a whole year's work, and then when I stole to keep from starving-- He glanced at the stranger.  No, I didn't steal just to keep from starving. I stole to be stealing. I can't seem to keep from stealing. Seems like when I see things, I just must--but, yes, I'll try!  The convict looked down at his striped clothes, but the stranger had taken off his long coat; he had put it around him and the stripes disappeared.  In the opening morning the black man started toward the low, log farmhouse in the distance, while the stranger stood watching him. There was a new glory in the day. The black man's face cleared up, and the farmer was glad to get him. All day the black man worked as he had never worked before. The farmer gave him some cold food.  You can sleep in the barn, he said, and turned away.  How much do I git a day? asked the black man.  The farmer scowled.  Now see here, said he. If you'll sign a contract for the season, I'll give you ten dollars a month.  I won't sign no contract, said the black man doggedly.  Yes, you will, said the farmer, threateningly, or I'll call the convict guard. And he grinned.  The convict shrank and slouched to the barn. As night fell he looked out and saw the farmer leave the place. Slowly he crept out and sneaked toward the house. He looked through the kitchen door. No one was there, but the supper was spread as if the mistress had laid it and gone out. He ate ravenously. Then he looked into the front room and listened. He could hear low voices on the porch. On the table lay a gold watch. He gazed at it, and in a moment he was beside it,--his hands were on it! Quickly he slipped out of the house and slouched toward the field. He saw his employer coming along the highway. He fled back in tenor and around to the front of the house, when suddenly he stopped. He felt the great, dark eyes of the stranger and saw the same dark, cloak-like coat where the stranger sat on the doorstep talking with the mistress of the house. Slowly, guiltily, he turned back, entered the kitchen, and laid the watch stealthily where he had found it; then he rushed wildly back toward the stranger, with arms outstretched.  The woman had laid supper for her husband, and going down from the house had walked out toward a neighbor's. She was gone but a little while, and when she came back she started to see a dark figure on the doorsteps under the tall, red oak. She thought it was the new Negro until he said in a soft voice:  Will you give me bread?  Reassured at the voice of a white man, she answered quickly in her soft, Southern tones:  Why, certainly.  She was a little woman, and once had been pretty; but now her face was drawn with work and care. She was nervous and always thinking, wishing, wanting for something. She went in and got him some cornbread and a glass of cool, rich buttermilk; then she came out and sat down beside him. She began, quite unconsciously, to tell him about herself,--the things she had done and had not done and the things she had wished for. She told him of her husband and this new farm they were trying to buy. She said it was hard to get niggers to work. She said they ought all to be in the chain-gang and made to work. Even then some ran away. Only yesterday one had escaped, and another the day before.  At last she gossiped of her neighbors, how good they were and how bad.  And do you like them all? asked the stranger.  She hesitated.  Most of them, she said; and then, looking up into his face and putting her hand into his, as though he were her father, she said:  There are none I hate; no, none at all.  He looked away, holding her hand in his, and said dreamily:  You love your neighbor as yourself?  She hesitated.  I try-- she began, and then looked the way he was looking; down under the hill where lay a little, half-ruined cabin.  They are niggers, she said briefly.  He looked at her. Suddenly a confusion came over her and she insisted, she knew not why.  But they are niggers!  With a sudden impulse she arose and hurriedly lighted the lamp that stood just within the door, and held it above her head. She saw his dark face and curly hair. She shrieked in angry terror and rushed down the path, and just as she rushed down, the black convict came running up with hands outstretched. They met in mid-path, and before he could stop he had run against her and she fell heavily to earth and lay white and still. Her husband came rushing around the house with a cry and an oath.  I knew it, he said. It's that runaway nigger. He held the black man struggling to the earth and raised his voice to a yell. Down the highway came the convict guard, with hound and mob and gun. They paused across the fields. The farmer motioned to them.  He--attacked--my wife, he gasped.  The mob snarled and worked silently. Right to the limb of the red oak they hoisted the struggling, writhing black man, while others lifted the dazed woman. Right and left, as she tottered to the house, she searched for the stranger with a yearning, but the stranger was gone. And she told none of her guests.  No--no, I want nothing, she insisted, until they left her, as they thought, asleep. For a time she lay still, listening to the departure of the mob. Then she rose. She shuddered as she heard the creaking of the limb where the body hung. But resolutely she crawled to the window and peered out into the moonlight; she saw the dead man writhe. He stretched his arms out like a cross, looking upward. She gasped and clung to the window sill. Behind the swaying body, and down where the little, half-ruined cabin lay, a single flame flashed up amid the far-off shout and cry of the mob. A fierce joy sobbed up through the terror in her soul and then sank abashed as she watched the flame rise. Suddenly whirling into one great crimson column it shot to the top of the sky and threw great arms athwart the gloom until above the world and behind the roped and swaying form below hung quivering and burning a great crimson cross.  She hid her dizzy, aching head in an agony of tears, and dared not look, for she knew. Her dry lips moved:  Despised and rejected of men.  She knew, and the very horror of it lifted her dull and shrinking eyelids. There, heaven-tall, earth-wide, hung the stranger on the crimson cross, riven and blood-stained, with thorn-crowned head and pierced hands. She stretched her arms and shrieked.  He did not hear. He did not see. His calm dark eyes, all sorrowful, were fastened on the writhing, twisting body of the thief, and a voice came out of the winds of the night, saying:  This day thou shalt be with me in Paradise!",
