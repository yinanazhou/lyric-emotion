        "Is There Anybody There? LyricsOpen my mind let me find new vibrations Tell me the way I must take to reach my destination And a place where I can stay Where is the love of my life couldn't find her Show me the way to come back to myself 'Cause I'm nowhere in the darkness of these days  Is there anybody there who feels that vibration Who shows me the way to my love Is there anybody there with that inclination To bring back the sun to my heart  I find myself in a state of confusion Life's like a pantomime trick or a laser illusion Where's a place that I can stay Save me don't let me get lost in the ocean I need your help everyday to control my emotions In the darkness of these days  Is there anybody there who feels that vibration Who shows me the way to my love Is there anybody there with that inclination To bring back the sun to my heart1Embed",
