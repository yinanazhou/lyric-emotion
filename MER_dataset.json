        "Michael Jackson, Inc. (Introduction) LyricsINTRODUCTION  Once every few months during the mid-1980s, a handful of America's savviest businessmen gathered to plot financial strategy for a billion-dollar entertainment conglomerate  This informal investment committee included David Geffen, who'd launched multiple record labels and would go on to become one of Hollywood's richest men after founding DreamWorks Studios; John Johnson, who started Ebony magazine and would become the first black man to appear in the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans; John Branca, who has since handled finances for dozens of Rock and Roll Hall of Famers including the Beach Boys and the Rolling Stones; and Michael Jackson, the King of Pop and chairman of the board, inscrutable in his customary sunglasses  Shares of the entertainment company in question were never traded on the New York Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ. Though few would even consider it to actually be a company, this multinational's products have been consumed by billions of people over the past few decades. Had the organization been officially incorporated, it might have been called Michael Jackson, Inc  In 1985, this conglomerate made its most substantial acquisition: ATV, the company that housed the prized music publishing catalogue of the Beatles. Included were copyrights to most of the band's biggest hits, including \"Yesterday,\" \"Come Together,\" \"Hey Jude,\" and hundreds of others  At an investment committee meeting months before the deal was consummated, however, the acquisition was looking unlikely. Michael Jackson, Inc. was deep into negotiations with Australian billionaire Robert Holmes a Court, whose asking price for ATV had soared past $40 million--prompting disagreement among Jackson's inner circle over how to proceed  CBS Records chief Walter Yetnikoff, a confidant who wasn't on the committee, found the price to be exorbitant, and he had plenty of company.1 Even Geffen seemed to think the bidding had gotten too high. Johnson thought differently. \"This is something you believe in and want to get,\" he told the singer. \"Don't blow it over price.\"2  Not wanting to upset anyone, Jackson remained silent--as he often did in meetings--but he'd already made his decision. He scrawled a note on the back of a financial statement and passed it to Branca beneath the table  \"John please let's not bargain,\" it read. \"I don't want to lose the deal . . . IT'S MY CATALOGUE.\"3  A few months later, Jackson purchased ATV for $47.5 million. Today, that investment alone is worth about $1 billion  As evidenced by the size of the empire he left behind when he died suddenly in 2009, Michael Jackson was effectively a corporation in and of himself. He was not only the founder and creative force behind this empire, but also its most important product. By the middle of the 1980s, he chaired an organization that included Branca (Jackson's chief executive officer, if you will), manager Frank Dileo (his chief marketing officer), and a handful of others  Jackson and his team made many game-changing moves beyond acquiring ATV. Among them: creating and promoting Thriller, the bestselling album of all time (roughly 100 million units sold), landing unprecedented endorsement deals with Pepsi ($5.2 million in 1983, $10 million in 1987, $15 million in 1990), and launching record-setting excursions like the Bad Tour ($125 million in gross ticket sales). The latter drew 4.4 million people, who each paid about $28 per ticket. With a modern price of $130, it would have grossed nearly $600 million, making it the second most lucrative tour of all time. At $200 per ticket, it would have been number one  \"I got to witness the divinity in him every night,\" says Sheryl Crow, who served as one of Jackson's backup singers on the Bad Tour. \"[He had] that thing that is not quantifiable--that thing that you watch, and you cannot figure out why it is that you feel the molecules in the room change, but you are aware of it.\"4 Perhaps most significantly, Jackson fundamentally changed the formula for monetizing fame forever. In addition to making the most successful music video of all time, starring in movies and penning a bestselling autobiography, he launched an eponymous clothing line, teamed up with Sega to place himself in a video game, and scored a deal for his own LA Gear sneaker, unbelievably earning a bigger initial guarantee than Michael Jordan did with Nike. All in all, he earned $1.1 billion in his career--$1.9 billion, adjusted for inflation (see appendix for a year-by-year breakdown)  \"He had good instincts . . . more, more, more; better, better, better,\" says Sandy Gallin, who served as Jackson's manager for the first half of the 1990s. \"He would, in his mind, negotiate the same way. No matter what anybody would offer, he wanted more.\"5  Jackson helped flip the paradigm of entertainer as contractor on its head, offering a new path: entertainer as owner. On top of the ATV deal, he secured the rights to his own master recordings and compositions, and launched his music imprint as a joint venture under the Sony umbrella. Not all of his gambits turned out as well as Jackson might have hoped; some failed altogether (for example, an attempt to buy a bankrupt Marvel Comics a decade before Disney purchased it for $4 billion), but most still earned him double-digit millions--and paved the way for the modern celebrity mogul  \"Michael Jackson was so much bigger than Jay Z or 50 Cent or anybody else who did it, in comparison,\" says 50 Cent, who completed the shoes-clothes-label trifecta years later. Jackson, he adds, is \"why music is the way it is now . . . you've seen a shift in an area [previously] reserved for professional athletes.\"6  For that reason and others, plenty of megastars still look up to the King of Pop as a trailblazer on and off the stage despite the moves that didn't work out. \"He was extremely smart,\" explains fellow actor-musician-entrepreneur Ludacris. \"From my perspective, because I'm business-oriented and savvy, I noticed and even read up on everything that he did.\"7 Adds superproducer Pharrell Williams: \"He was so far advanced in the way he thought about things.\"8  The tale of Michael Jackson, Inc. begins with its namesake's early days as part of the Jackson 5, touring the \"chitlin circuit.\" At gigs, Jackson met famous musicians like Smokey Robinson, Gladys Knight, and Jackie Wilson. Even at age seven, he'd ask question after question not only about their performances, but about how the music industry worked  Along the way, Jackson developed a sense of perfectionism, something his violent father pounded into his son with his fists after miscues in rehearsal. At age nine, Jackson gained a comparatively kinder, gentler mentor in Berry Gordy--who founded his own entertainment conglomerate, Motown Records, and signed the Jackson 5 to the label in 1968. Under Gordy's tutelage, Jackson eagerly absorbed lessons on how to write, record, market, and profit from a song  \"I was a person that had a lot of rules and sayings,\" says Gordy. \"Stuff like . . . 'You have to capture your audience in the first twenty seconds; if you don't, then you can't release it' [and] 'It's not in how much you promote it, it's not about that, it's what's in the groove.' \"9  Jackson's early experience paved the way for the monster deals he made as an adult with the help of advisors like his longtime attorney Branca, whom he handpicked at age twenty-one. The lawyer set a new industry high with Jackson's royalty rate ahead of Thriller, which still stands as the bestselling album in history. On top of ATV, Branca was able to help Jackson land the catalogues of Bread, Sly and the Family Stone, and a handful of songs made famous by Elvis Presley  \"Michael Jackson had the mindset of being a businessman the whole time by acquiring businesses,\" says Kevin Liles, former president of Def Jam Records. \"[It was like] the Michael Jackson private equity firm.\"10 Even his Neverland Ranch, purchased for $17.5 million in 1988, has soared in value--some real estate veterans say it could fetch as much as $75 million11 to $100 million on the open market.12  With some help from his team, Jackson also revolutionized the modern music video after overcoming fierce resistance from MTV, which had largely avoided airing music by black artists before caving on Jackson's \"Billie Jean.\" His subsequent \"short films,\" as he liked to call them--namely, \"Beat It\" and \"Thriller\"--shattered the notion of what a video could be, both artistically and commercially. Today, there's only one music video in the Library of Congress's exclusive National Film Registry: \"Thriller.\"13  \"That was the beginning, in my estimation, of music videos becoming the chief promotional tool to sell music,\" says Fred \"Fab 5 Freddy\" Brathwaite, longtime host of the show Yo! MTV Raps. \"Radio play was important, but seeing the artist--and the artist being able to give you a good performance--solidified and became indelible along with the sounds.\"14  Jackson also aimed to instill a sense of marketing in everyone on his team. In 1986, he gave them copies of Humbug, a biography of circus impresario P. T. Barnum; he wanted his life to be the greatest show on earth. At his insistence, lieutenants planted fantastical stories about him in mainstream publications and the tabloids But Barnum was a complicated role model. Though the aforementioned book describes him as perhaps the greatest showman in American history, it also reveals him to be \"a hardheaded businessman [who] followed no battle plan to victory,\" someone who thought all publicity was good, and was at the same time \"self-conscious, and anxious for a claim on national gratitude.\"15 At times, the same could be said about the King of Pop  When Jackson stopped supplying fresh story fodder in the late 1980s, the press started doing it for him. Outrageous headlines followed him throughout his life (\"Michael Jackson: Prince Using ESP to Drive My Chimp Crazy\") and after his death (\"MJ Is Alive--And Running for President\"). After he was accused of child molestation in 1993, his image took a hit that would last the rest of his life. His ever-changing physical appearance, altered both by voluntary cosmetic surgery and by the onset of vitiligo, didn't enhance his reputation  Even so, Jackson had his share of triumphs during the final decade and a half of his life. On the business end, he and his team convinced Sony to pay $115 million for the privilege of merging its publishing arm with his catalogue, creating Sony/ATV, a joint venture now worth about $2 billion. He played to millions of fans abroad in support of his double album HIStory. On the personal side, he started a family of his own and set a Guinness World Record for the most charities supported by a pop star.16  But he didn't launch a full-scale tour in the United States or earn another endorsement deal after 1993, and his legal troubles sank a budding film career on both sides of the camera. Jackson became deeply distrustful of many of his closest advisors, sometimes with good reason, sometimes not. As a consequence, he disbanded his original business team and replaced it with a carousel of sycophants  Without a consistent group of advisors to help refine and execute ideas--and to tether his creative genius to reality--the financial prospects of Michael Jackson, Inc. dimmed considerably. After Jackson's annual income stream reached twin peaks of $125 million in 1988 and $118 million in 1995, it declined to $18 million by 1998 and hovered in that vicinity for the rest of his life. But his expenditures remained high as ever. \"He did have a business head,\" says Walter Yetnikoff, Jackson's longtime boss at CBS Records. \"His problem was that he overspent.\"17  The perfectionistic impulses that had helped him create Thriller drove Jackson to spend increasingly outrageous quantities of time and money trying to top it. For Invincible, released in 2001, he ran up recording costs of $30 million to $40 million in an era where $1 million was considered a fairly large budget. He never released another studio album. By 2009, though he was still rich on paper thanks to his Sony/ATV stake and personal publishing holdings, he was running out of cash and nearing the point where he'd have to sell those assets to pay back his loans  \"All people who become legends overnight, especially when they're very young, people do not tell them no,\" says film director Joel Schumacher, who first worked with Michael Jackson on the 1978 film The Wiz. \"So they actually learn to become a person that cannot take no. And they make sure there's no one around them that says no. And many times the entourage can [lead] you to your demise.\"18  Jackson died on June 25, 2009, of a drug overdose administered by a member of that retinue--his personal doctor, Conrad Murray, who was later convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to four years in prison. But when the news of Jackson's death broke, something fascinating happened. The public's tattered memories of his later years seemed to fade as Thriller returned to heavy rotation on radio stations around the world  Indeed, the music video medium that Jackson had reinvented was suddenly securing his legacy. By the morning after his death, a new generation of fans had watched a young, handsome Jackson resolve conflict through dance in the short film for \"Beat It\" on YouTube. In twenty-four hours, the singer's music racked up 3 million spins on MySpace alone.19 Jackson sold a record 8 million albums in the US that year--nearly twice as many as the runner-up, Taylor Swift.20  Within just a few months, a resurrected Michael Jackson, Inc.--led by coexecutors John Branca and music industry veteran John McClain--was flourishing once again. Deals included a $60 million advance for This Is It (a film based on the concert series for which Jackson was rehearsing when he died), a record deal with Sony worth $250 million (the largest in history), and an agreement with Cirque du Soleil to produce a roving spectacle based on Jackson's music. The show would make him the top touring act in North America--and help wipe away his personal debts--just three years after he passed away. All in all, Jackson's estate has earned over $700 million in the five years since his death, more than any musician dead or alive during that period  Covering this ongoing story for Forbes made me aware of the magnitude of Michael Jackson's postmortem business--and of the fascinating story behind the assets he accumulated and cultivated during his life. The realization that his most important moves were not simply executed by savvy handlers, but in many cases driven by Jackson's own intelligence and intuition, gave me the idea for Michael Jackson, Inc  My first book, Empire State of Mind, was a business-focused biography of Jay Z, someone widely lauded for his skills as a mogul. I saw that I could approach Jackson's career from a similar angle. But I also identified with Jackson in a way that few others likely do: I was, briefly, a child actor. And though my experience constituted perhaps a single note when compared to the double album of childhood pain and pressure that Jackson experienced, I did get a taste of the delicious, terrible, reality-bending world of show business  At around the same age Jackson started performing, I played the title role in Lorenzo's Oil alongside Susan Sarandon and Nick Nolte. I began to notice a change in the way people perceived me not long after my sixth birthday, when I found myself signing autographs for a pair of girls one year my senior. Stranger still, after months playing a very sick child, donning a bald cap every morning and sometimes wearing an earpiece designed to make me slur my speech, I began to wonder if I might be ill myself Eventually, I decided on \"early retirement\" and shifted my focus to more meaningful pursuits like winning a middle school intramural basketball championship. My parents were more than willing to let me leave show business, a luxury that Michael Jackson never had. That's not to say he wouldn't have chosen to be an entertainer; Jackson brought unparalleled electricity to his performances, something that could only have been generated by an inner drive as prodigious as his outsized talent  \"Onstage for me was home,\" Jackson told Oprah Winfrey in 1993. \"I was most comfortable, and still am most comfortable, onstage. But once I got off stage, I was very sad . . . I used to always cry from loneliness.\"21  The struggles of his childhood bred in him a combination of perfectionism and insecurity--one that fed his desire to constantly break new ground in the fields of music, dance, and film--but also resulted in negative consequences both for his personal happiness and the success of his business empire  In the coming pages, I retrace the steps of Jackson's journey from impoverished child to international superstar, notebook in hand as I travel to his birthplace of Gary, Indiana; the Apollo Theater in New York; his adopted hometown of Los Angeles and the rolling hills of Neverland; even the lush midlands of Ireland and the blazing neon lights of Las Vegas  Along the way, I draw on interviews with more than a hundred people who witnessed Jackson's rise as a musician--and as a business--including members of his immediate and extended family, industry executives who helped him build his empire, and various entertainers and Hollywood veterans who came to know and work with him over the years. My reporting relies on firsthand interviews with many of the key players in Jackson's life, and I have avoided the use of press clippings and secondary sources as much as possible. In the instances where I've used these, they're mostly limited to color (album reviews, honorifics, times, and dates)  This is a book about Michael Jackson's business and everything that went into it. That includes the bundle of contradictions that could be used to describe him: a supremely confident visionary occasionally crippled by insecurity, a warm and generous human being capable of stonewalling colleagues to get his way, an ambitious long-term planner who sometimes left his side of multimillion-dollar agreements unfinished, a showbiz revolutionary who eventually lost control of his personal finances  His highs were as high as anyone's, if not higher, and even his lows offer valuable lessons. The story of how Jackson transformed himself from a poor kid in a hardscrabble steel town into the world's most successful superstar--and a business unto himself--makes him a remarkable case study for generations of entertainers to come, both on the stage and in the boardroom  \"He had a kid's heart, but a mind of a genius,\" says Berry Gordy. \"He was so loving and soft-spoken, and a thinker. . . . He wanted to do everything, and he was capable. You can only do so much in a lifetime.\"226Embed",

Everyone I know Goes away in the end And you could have it all My empire of dirt I will let you down I will make you hurt  [Outro] If I could start again A million miles away I would keep myself I would find a way142Embed",
        "Lonely Boy LyricsI'm just a lonely boy Lonely and blue I'm all alone With nothin' to do  I've got everything You could think of But all I want Is someone to love  Someone, yes, someone to love Someone to kiss Someone to hold At a moment like this  I'd like to hear Somebody say I'll give you my love Each night and day  I'm just a lonely boy Lonely and blue I'm all alone With nothin' to do  I've got everything You could think of But all I want Is someone to love Somebody, somebody, somebody, please Send her to me I'll make her happy Just wait and see  I've prayed so hard To the heavens above That I might find Someone to love  I'm just a lonely boy Lonely and blue I'm all alone With nothin' to do  I've got everything You could think ofEmbed",

        "The Lady Of Shalott LyricsOn either side of the river lie Long fields of barley and of rye That clothe the wold and meet the sky; And thro' the field the road run by To many-towered Camelot; And up and down the people go Gazing where the lilies flow Round an island there below The island of Shalott  Willows whiten, aspens quiver Little breezes dusk and shiver Thro' the wave that runs for ever By the island in the river Flowing down to Camelot Four grey walls, and four grey towers Overlook a space of flowers And the silent isle embowers The Lady of Shalott  Only reapers, reaping early In among the bearded barley Hear a song that echoes cheerly From the river winding clearly Down to tower'd Camelot; And by the moon the reaper weary Piling sheaves in uplands airy Listening, whispers \"'tis the fairy The Lady of Shalott.\" There she weaves by night and day A magic web with colours gay She has heard a whisper say A curse is on her if she stay To look down to Camelot She knows not what the curse may be And so she weaveth steadily And little other care hath she The Lady of Shalott  And moving through a mirror clear That hangs before her all the year Shadows of the world appear There she sees the highway near Winding down to Camelot; And sometimes thro' the mirror blue The knights come riding two and two She hath no loyal knight and true The Lady Of Shalott But in her web she still delights To weave the mirror's magic sights For often thro' the silent nights A funeral, with plumes and lights And music, went to Camelot; Or when the moon was overhead Came two young lovers lately wed \"I am half sick of shadows,\" she said The Lady Of Shalott A bow-shot from her bower-eaves He rode between the barley sheaves The sun came dazzling thro' the leaves And flamed upon the brazen greaves Of bold Sir Lancelot A red-cross knight for ever kneel'd To a lady in his shield That sparkled on the yellow field Beside remote Shalott  His broad clear brow in sunlight glow'd; On burnish'd hooves his war-horse trode; From underneath his helmet flow'd His coal-black curls as on he rode As he rode down to Camelot From the bank and from the river He flashed into the crystal mirror \"Tirra Lirra,\" by the river Sang Sir Lancelot  She left the web, she left the loom She made three paces thro' the room She saw the water-lily bloom She saw the helmet and the plume She looked down to Camelot Out flew the web and floated wide; The mirror cracked from side to side; \"The curse is come upon me,\" cried The Lady of Shalott In the stormy east-wind straining The pale yellow woods were waning The broad stream in his banks complaining Heavily the low sky raining Over towered Camelot; Down she came and found a boat Beneath a willow left afloat And round about the prow she wrote The Lady of Shalott  And down the river's dim expanse Like some bold seer in a trance Seeing all his own mischance - With a glassy countenance Did she look to Camelot And at the closing of the day She loosed the chain and down she lay; The broad stream bore her far away The Lady of Shalott  Heard a carol, mournful, holy Chanted loudly, chanted lowly Till her blood was frozen slowly And her eyes were darkened wholly Turn'd to towered Camelot For ere she reach'd upon the tide The first house by the water-side Singing in her song she died The Lady of Shalott  Under tower and balcony By garden-wall and gallery A gleaming shape she floated by Dead-pale between the houses high Silent into Camelot Out upon the wharfs they came Knight and burgher, lord and dame And round the prow they read her name The Lady of Shalott  Who is this? And what is here? And in the lighted palace near Died the sound of royal cheer; And they crossed themselves for fear All the knights at Camelot; But Lancelot mused a little space He said, \"She has a lovely face; God in his mercy lend her grace The Lady of Shalott.\"Embed",

We are turning into dust Playing house in the ruins of us Running back through the fire When there's nothing left to save It's like chasing the very last train When it's too late, too late [Pre-Chorus: James Morrison & Nelly Furtado] Oh, it tears me up I tried to hold on but it hurts too much I tried to forgive but it's not enough To make it all okay  [Chorus: James Morrison & Nelly Furtado] You can't play on broken strings You can't feel anything That your heart don't want to feel I can't tell you something that ain't real Oh, the truth hurts and lies worse How can I give anymore? When I love you a little less than before?  [Bridge: James Morrison & Nelly Furtado] But we're running through the fire When there's nothing left to save It's like chasing the very last train When we both know it's too late, too late  [Chorus: James Morrison & Nelly Furtado] You can't play on broken strings You can't feel anything That your heart don't want to feel I can't tell you something that ain't real Oh, the truth hurts and lies worse So how can I give anymore When I love you a little less than before?

Is it East versus West or man against man? Can any nation stand alone?  [Chorus] In the burning heart just about to burst There's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst In the darkest night rising like a spire In the burning heart the unmistakable fire In the burning heart  [Verse 2] In the warriors code there's no surrender Though his body says stop his spirit cries - never! Deep in our soul a quiet ember knows it's you against you It's the paradox that drives us on It's a battle of wills In the heat of attack it's the passion that kills The victory is yours alone [Chorus] In the burning heart just about to burst There's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst In the darkest night rising like a spire In the burning heart the unmistakable fire  [Instrumental Bridge]  [Chorus] In the burning heart just about to burst There's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst In the darkest night rising like a spire In the burning heart the unmistakable fire In the burning heart just about to burst There's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst In the darkest night rising like a spire In the burning heart the unmistakable fire  [Outro] In the burning heart8Embed",

        "Fair Fortune: A Wrock Opera LyricsNarrator: High on a hill in an enchanted garden was the Fountain of Fair Fortune Once every year, on the longest day, the Fountain lets one person go through And fight to the Fountain, and bathe in its waters, and receive their happiness too  Altheda: Good morning, witches, how are you today?  Asha: Better, if I could be the one to bathe  Amata: Me, too; I'm Amata; what are your names? And what do you suffer?  Asha: My name is Asha, and I am quite ill I cannot be healed by magic or pill To bathe in the Fountain is my only will So I can be cured  Altheda: And I, Altheda, was robbed of my home A sorcerer stole my wand and my gold Now I leave, impoverished and cold The Fountain can help me  Amata: And I'm in love with a man who left me Though he is gone, I still love him dearly I want to heal my heart finally So I can move on, move on Narrator: It's time!  Altheda: Wait, I have an idea: Let's reach the Fountain as one  Amata: But how?  Altheda: We'll all grab hands and hold on tight  Asha, Altheda and Amata: Our adventure has just begun We'll fight to the Fountain and bathe in its waters 'Til our sadnesses are undone  Asha: The vines have got me! Quick, grab my wrist!  Altheda: Amata!  Amata: Got it  Asha: It's working!  Amata: Wait! I'm stuck on something  ???: Ow!  Asha, Altheda and ???: What's going on? Amata: It's too late! We're all getting pulled through the wall  ???: Wow  Asha and Altheda: What's he doing here?  Amata: I- I'm sorry, I got caught on him  Asha and Altheda: Who are you?  Sir Luckless: My name's Sir Luckless, and I'm out of luck By your magic powers, I am struck I have no skill or magic; I'm stuck So I will withdraw  Amata: Faint heart! Faint heart! Please help us fight Come, draw your sword and be a brave knight  Sir Luckless: Faint heart! Faint heart! I'm not prepared  Amata: Can I help?  Sir Luckless: I wish the Fountain can save me from being scared  Amata: Can I save you from being scared? We'll help you, then -- won't we? Altheda: If you two are done having your moment, can we please move on?  Amata: Sorry  *  Narrator: The witches and sad knight ventured forth through the garden thick and lush The sun was blazing overhead, and the quartet started to rush  All: To fight to the Fountain and bathe in its waters, 'til their painful thoughts were hushed  Asha: Stop  Sir Luckless: What?  Amata: What's wrong?  Asha: Shh! It might hear us  Altheda: I don't see anything. What is it?  Asha: A giant worm We're going to have to pass it It's blocking the whole path; it knows we're here We've got to reach the Fountain There's no use staying put in fear  Asha, Altheda, Amata and Sir Luckless: There's no turning back now As we approach this monster, bloated and white Lord knows that we are nervous But we will not give up the fight  Voice: Pay me the proof of your pain  Altheda: What?

Asha: Guess what?  Altheda: What?  Asha: I'm smiling  *  Narrator: Our heroes moved forward with even more haste, and began to climb a hill But halfway up the steepened slope came their second obstacle  All: To fight to the Fountain and bathe in its waters, 'til their wishes were fulfilled  Altheda: Look!  Sir Luckless: What?  Altheda: Written on the ground  Voice: Pay me the fruit of your labours  Asha: The what?  Altheda: Like, real fruit?  Amata: Or money!  Sir Luckless: I have a coin  Amata: Put it on the hill!  Asha: Oh no, it's rolling away!

Sir Luckless: We've been going for hours  Amata: The summit gets no closer And the words are still on the ground  Altheda: Don't fear now We'll make it somehow Walk with me, feel the sweat on your brow  Take it slow No matter how far we have to go We will get there, this I know  So heed my guide I have nothing left but my pride And I won't lose that too  Please be strong We've been walking for so long Take my hand, hear my song  Asha, Altheda, Amata and Sir Luckless: Be my guide We won't lose our pride  Sir Luckless: Look! Altheda's sweat has made the inscription vanish!  Asha: We can move upward now  *  Narrator: Once more, our team climbed up a hill, and they glimpsed the Fountain afar But a third challenge blocked their way; they had no clue what they had in store  All: To fight to the Fountain and bathe in its waters, 'til their woes were no more  Sir Luckless: Oh, no!  Asha: A stream is blocking our path  Amata: Look, in the middle! An inscription on the stone!  Voice: Pay me the treasures of your past  Altheda: Not another riddle!  Sir Luckless: Let me float across on my shield  Asha: I really don't think that will ...  Sir Luckless: Here I go!  Amata: He's sinking! Quick, pull him out!

Amata: I know what to do I'll remember  I'll remember, even though I don't want to I'll remember all the good times I had with you Tried to block you out of my mind But I knew that, in time, I'd remember Be forced to remember  I remember The touch of your hand The sound of your voice Your lips on my lips Memories, taking over me Begone, memories, begone!  I'll cast you into the stream Pay the treasures of my past And maybe I'll finally be free Of the memories that plague me, break me  Sir Luckless: Amata ...  Asha: Shh  Amata: I'll remember All the happy times we had But now I'm just sad Because I love you and you're gone  Sir Luckless: Does she see me?  Amata: My memory's a sign Forget the tears I've cried  Sir Luckless: Will she ever see me?  Amata: And move on, Amata  Both: Move on!  Asha, Altheda and Sir Luckless: Remember the happy times you had And don't be sad 'cause he's gone  Amata: And I won't be sad  Asha and Altheda: Your memory's a sign  Sir Luckless: Does she see me?  Amata: I'll forget the tears I've cried  Asha, Altheda and Amata: And move on, and we can move on Move on  Amata: [sobs]  Sir Luckless: Amata, I --  Asha: Look! Stepping stones have appeared across the river! And I can see the Fountain!  Altheda: Let's go!  Sir Luckless: Amata, are you all right?  Amata: Yeah, I'm fine. Let's get this over --  Asha: [screams]  Altheda: Asha?  Asha: Help!  Amata: What's going on?  Sir Luckless: What happened?  Altheda: She's collapsed. Asha, Asha!  Asha: Please I am close to death, so don't touch me Just leave me be, thanks to you I've remembered how to smile  Sir Luckless: Asha?  Altheda: No! I won't let her die. Luckless, give me your water gourd  Sir Luckless: What are you doing?  Altheda: I'll bet one of the herbs in this enchanted garden will cure Asha  Asha, Altheda, Amata and Sir Luckless: Please  Altheda, Amata and Sir Luckless: Let there be something to save our friend She's at the end of her days  Asha: Please  Altheda, Amata and Sir Luckless: And now we can barely smile  Altheda: Here, Asha. Drink this  [pause]  Asha: There I was Thinking that my sickness had no cure But now I'm feeling better, thanks to her  I don't need the Fountain anymore! I'm healed! Let Altheda bathe!  Altheda: But, if I can cure this disease, I can earn all the gold I need! Let Amata bathe  Amata: Ha! I don't need to. I've moved on  Sir Luckless: You have?  Asha: Go ahead, brave knight. You've earned it  Sir Luckless: Brave, me? Grew up in a castle, far away from here Never matched the other knights with horse or sword or spear But it seems that all my dreams are coming true here with you, my friends  Never watched a sunrise with anybody else Never told a secret, except for to myself Now I'm watching sunsets and bathing in the Fountain  Asha, Altheda, Amata and Sir Luckless: With you, my friends  Sir Luckless: Amata, I have a confession to make When you all grabbed hands, I grabbed onto your cape I thought you were the most beautiful woman I'd ever seen  Amata: Faint heart! Faint heart!  Sir Luckless: I have a faint heart  Both: Please take my heart and never let it go  Asha, Altheda, Amata and Sir Luckless: Now we are four friends, and we walk side by side We've kept our memories, our smiles, our pride And what happens now, only fate will decide  Narrator: They fought to the Fountain, they bathed in its waters Though there was no magic inside  Asha, Altheda, Amata and Sir Luckless: The magic was in our handsEmbed",

Yo [Verse 1] His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's Back to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and  [Chorus] You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go) You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go) You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You better...

        "The Last Runaway Lyrics                                           Horizon SHE COULD NOT GO back. When Honor Bright abruptly announced to her family that she would accompany her sister Grace to America - when she sorted through her belongings, keeping only the most necessary, when she gave away all of her quilts, when she said goodbye to her uncles and aunts, and kissed her cousins and nieces and nephews, when she got into the coach that would take them from Bridport, when she and Grace linked arms and walked up the gangplank at Bristol - she did all of these things with the unspoken thought: I can always come back. Layered beneath those words, however, was the suspicion that the moment her feet left English soil, Honor's life would be permanently altered.      At least the idea of returning drew the sting from her actions in the weeks leading up to their departure, like the pinch of sugar secretly added to a sauce to tame its acid. It allowed her to remain calm, and not cry as her friend Biddy did when Honor gave her the quilt she had just finished: a patchwork of brown, yellow and cream diamonds pieced into an eight-point Star of Bethlehem, then quilted with harps and the running feather border she was known for. The community had given her a signature quilt - each square made and signed by a different friend or family member - and there was not room for both quilts in her trunk. The signature quilt was not so well made as her own, but of course she must take it. ''Tis best left with thee, to remember me by,' she insisted as her weeping friend tried to push the Star of Bethlehem quilt back at her. 'I will make more quilts in Ohio.'      Jumping over thoughts of the journey itself, Honor tried to fix her mind instead on its end at the clapboard house her future brother-in-law had sketched for Grace in his letters from Ohio. 'It is a solid house, even if not of the stone thee is accustomed to,' Adam Cox had written. 'Most houses here are made of wood. Only when a family is established and unlikely to move do they build a brick house.      'It is situated at the end of Main Street on the edge of the town,' he had continued. 'Faithwell is still small, with fifteen families of Friends. But it will grow, by the grace of God. My brother's shop is in Oberlin, a larger town three miles away. He and I hope to move it when Faithwell has grown large enough to support a draper's. Here we call it \"dry goods\". There are many new words to learn in America.'      Honor could not imagine living in a house made of wood, that burned so quickly, warped easily, creaked and groaned and gave no feeling of permanence the way brick or stone did.      Though she tried to keep her worries confined to the notion of living in a wooden house, she could not stop her mind straying to thoughts of the voyage on the Adventurer, the ship that would take them across the Atlantic. Honor was familiar with ships, as any Bridport resident would be. She sometimes accompanied her father to the harbour when a shipment of hemp arrived. She had even gone on board, and watched the sailors furling sails and coiling ropes and mopping decks. But she had never set sail in one. Once when she was ten her father took them to nearby Eype for the day, and Honor and Grace and her brothers had gone out in a rowing boat. Grace had loved being on the water, and had shrieked and laughed and pretended to fall in. Honor, however, had gripped the side of the boat while her brothers rowed, and tried not to appear alarmed at the rocking, and the curious and unpleasant sensation of no longer having stable footing. She had watched her mother walking up and down the beach in her dark dress and white bonnet, waiting for her children to come back safely. Honor avoided going out in a boat again.  She had heard stories of bad crossings but hoped she would cope with such a thing as she did any other hardship, with steady patience. But she did not have sea legs. That was what the sailors said. Perhaps she should have realised this from her encounter with water under her feet in the rowing boat. After leaving Bristol she stood on deck with Grace and others, watching the Somerset and north Devon coast unfold alongside them. For the other passengers the unsteadiness was an amusing novelty, but Honor grew more and more unsettled, responding to the ship's movement with a wrinkled brow, tightening shoulders and a heaviness deep in her gut, as if she had swallowed an iron pound weight. She held out as long as she could, but as the Adventurer was passing Lundy Island, Honor's stomach finally convulsed and she vomited on to the deck. A passing sailor laughed. 'Sick and we're barely out of Bristol Channel!' he crowed. 'Wait till we reach the ocean. Then you'll know sickness!'      Honor was sick down Grace's shoulder, on to her blankets, on to the floor of their tiny cabin, into an enamel basin. She threw up when there was nothing left to bring up, her body like a magician managing to conjure something from nothing. She did not feel better after each bout. When they reached the Atlantic and the ship began its long roll up and down the swell of the waves, she continued to be sick. Only now Grace was ill too, as well as many of the other passengers, though only for a time, until they got used to the new rhythm of the boat. Honor never got used to it; the nausea did not leave her for the whole month-long voyage.      When not seasick herself, Grace nursed Honor, rinsing her sheets, emptying the basin, bringing broth and hard sea biscuit, reading to her from the Bible or the few books they had brought: Mansfield Park, The Old Curiosity Shop, Martin Chuzzlewit. To distract Honor she chattered on about America, trying to get her to think about what lay ahead rather than the grimness of the present moment. 'What would thee rather see, a bear or a wolf?' she asked, then answered her own question. 'A bear, I think, for wolves are like overgrown dogs, but a bear is only like itself. What would thee rather travel on: a steamboat or a train?'      Honor groaned at the thought of another boat. 'Yes, a train,' Grace agreed. 'I wish there were a train we could take from New York to Ohio. There will be one day. Oh, Honor, imagine: soon we will be in New York!'      Honor grimaced, wishing that she too could see this move as the great adventure Grace clearly did. Her sister had always been the restless Bright, the one most ready to accompany their father when he had to travel to Bristol or Portsmouth or London. She had even agreed to marry an older, duller man because of the promise he held out of a life away from Bridport. Grace had known the Coxes, a family of five brothers, since they moved from Exeter several years before to open a draper's shop, but she only showed interest in Adam when he decided to emigrate to Ohio. A brother - Matthew - had already gone there but had become infirm, and his wife had written to ask a spare brother to come and help with the business. Once Adam had moved to America, he and Grace corresponded regularly, and with gentle hints she led him to ask her to join him in Ohio as his wife, where they would run the shop with Matthew and Abigail.      The Brights were surprised by Grace's choice; Honor had thought she would marry someone livelier. But Grace was so thrilled by the prospect of living in America that she did not seem to mind her prospective husband's reserve.     Though patient, and perhaps feeling guilty for subjecting her sister to weeks of seasickness, even Grace grew irritated by Honor's persistent illness. After a few days she stopped urging her to eat, as Honor never kept anything down for more than a few minutes. She began to leave her sister alone in their cabin to walk on deck and sit and sew and chat with the other women on board.      Honor tried to accompany Grace to a Meeting for Divine Worship organised by the handful of other Friends on board, but as she sat in silence with them in a small cabin, she could not let go of her thoughts enough to empty her mind, worrying that if she did so, she might lose what little self-control she had and vomit in front of them. Soon the rocking of the ship and the upheaval in her stomach forced her to leave the cabin.      Sometimes on the fraught voyage between Bristol and New York, when she was curled like a shrimp in her cramped berth or doubled over a chamber pot, Honor thought of her mother standing on the pebbles at Eype beach in her white bonnet, and wondered why she had left the safety of her parents' house.      She knew why: Grace had asked her, hoping a new life would quell her sister's heartache. Honor had been jilted and, though her spirit was less adventurous, the prospect of remaining in a community that pitied her propelled her into following Grace. She had never been dissatisfied in Bridport, but once Samuel had released her from their engagement, she was as eager as Grace to leave.      All of her clothes stank with a sour meatiness no washing could remove. Honor avoided the other passengers, and even her sister: she couldn't bear the disgust mixed with pity in their faces. Instead she found a space between two barrels on the leeward deck where she tucked herself out of the way of busy sailors and curious passengers, but close enough to the railing that she could run across and heave into the water without drawing attention. She remained on deck even in the rain and the cold, preferring it to the tiny cabin with its hard board for a bed and the close stench of her blankets. She was, however, indifferent to the seascape - the huge sky and sea that were such a contrast to the neat green hills and hedgerows of Dorset. While others were amazed and entertained by the storm clouds and rainbows and sunlight turning the water to silver, by schools of dolphins following the ship, by the sight of the tail of a whale, for Honor monotony and nausea struck dead any wonder she might have felt for such feats of nature.      When not leaning over the railing, she tried to take her mind off her sore, churning stomach by bringing out her patchwork. As a gift for the journey her mother had cut out hundreds of yellow and cream cloth hexagons and paper templates for Honor to sew into rosettes. She had hoped she might complete a whole grandmother's garden quilt during the voyage, but the swaying of the deck made it impossible for her to establish a steady rhythm in which to make the neat, tiny stitches that were her trademark. Even the simplest task of tacking the hexagons on to the templates with loose stitches - the first sewing Honor had learned as a young girl - required more concentration than the movement of the ocean allowed. It soon became clear that whatever cloth she worked with would be forever tainted with nausea, or the idea of it, which was much the same thing. After a few days of trying to sew the rosettes, Honor waited until no one was about, then dropped the hexagons overboard - they would make her sick if she ever saw that fabric again. It was a shocking waste of precious cloth, and she knew she should have given them to Grace or other women on board, but she was ashamed of the smell that lingered on them, and of her weakness. Watching the bits of cloth flutter down to the water and disappear, Honor felt her stomach grow calm for just a moment.      'Look at the horizon,' a sailor commanded one day after witnessing her dry heaves. 'Get up the bow and keep your eyes on where we headed. Pay no mind to the humping and bumping, the rocking and the rolling. Watch what don't move. Then your stomach'll settle.'      Honor nodded, though she knew it would not work, as she had already tried it. She had tried everything anyone suggested: ginger, a hot water bottle on her feet, a bag of ice on her neck. Now she studied the sailor out of the corner of her eye, for she had never seen a black man up close before. None lived in Bridport, and when she visited Bristol once she'd seen a black coachman drive past, but he was gone before she could take him in properly. Honor eyed the man's skin: it was the colour of a conker from a horse chestnut tree, though rough and wind-burned rather than smooth and shiny. He made her think of an apple that has ripened to a deep, rich red on the tree while its neighbours remain pale green. His accent was untraceable, from everywhere and nowhere.      The sailor was studying her too. Perhaps he had not seen many Quakers before, or he was curious what she looked like when her face was not ragged with nausea. Normally Honor's forehead was smooth, punctuated with eyebrows like wings over wide grey eyes. Her seasickness, however, etched lines where there had been none, and pinched the calm beauty from her face.      'The sky is so big it frightens me,' she said, surprising herself by speaking.      'Better get used to that. Everything's big where you headed. Why you going to America, then? Going to find you a husband? Englishmen not good enough for you?'      No, she thought. They are not. 'I am accompanying my sister,' she answered. 'She is marrying a man in Ohio.'      'Ohio!' The sailor snorted. 'Stick to the coast, love. Don't go nowhere you can't smell the sea, that's what I say. You'll get trapped out there in all them woods. Oh, there she goes.' He stepped back as Honor leaned over the railing once again.     The captain of the Adventurer said it was the smoothest, quickest crossing the ship had ever made across the Atlantic. This knowledge only tormented Honor. After thirty days at sea she stumbled, skeletal, on to the docks at New York, feeling she had vomited out every bit of her insides so that only a shell of her remained. To her horror, the ground heaved and bucked as much as the ship's deck had, and she threw up one last time.      She knew then that if she couldn't cope with the easiest crossing God could give her, she would never be able to go back to England. While Grace knelt on the docks and thanked God for reaching America, Honor began to cry, for England and her old life. An impossible ocean now lay between her and home. She could not go back.                                                          Mansion House Hotel                                                         Hudson, Ohio                                                         5th Month 26th 1850      My dear Mother and Father, William and George,      It is with the heaviest heart that I must tell you of the passing today of our beloved Grace. God has taken her so young, and when she was so close to reaching her new life in America.      I am writing from a hotel in Hudson, Ohio, where Grace remained during the final stage of her illness. The doctor said it was yellow fever, which is apparently more common in America than in England. I can only accept his diagnosis, since I am unfamiliar with the disease and its symptoms. Having witnessed my sister's painful demise, I can say that Dorset is lucky to be spared such a horror.      I have already written of our journey across to New York. I hope you received my letters from New York and Philadelphia. I do not always feel confident when I hand letters over here that they will reach their destination. In New York we changed our original travel plans, and decided to go by stage to Philadelphia and across Pennsylvania to Ohio, rather than take boats along the rivers and canals of New York to Lake Erie and down to Cleveland. Though many told me that such boats are very different from ships on seas, still I could not face being on the water again. I fear now that my lack of courage proved fatal to Grace, for perhaps she would not have caught the fever if we had gone by boat. With your forgiveness and God's understanding, I must live with this guilt.      Apart from a mild bout of seasickness, Grace remained very well on the crossing, and down to Philadelphia, where we stayed with Friends for a week to recover from our journey. While there we were able to attend the Arch Street Meeting. I have never imagined one could be so large - there must have been five hundred Friends in the room, twenty times the size of Bridport. I am glad that Grace was able to witness such a Meeting in her life.      When travelling to Ohio, there is an established network of Friends one may stay with in Pennsylvania. All along the way - in large cities like Harrisburg and Pittsburgh and smaller settlements too - we were welcomed, even when Grace showed the first signs of the yellow fever, two days out from Harrisburg. It begins with a fever and chills and nausea, which could be any number of illnesses, so at first there was little concern except for Grace's discomfort in the various coaches in which we crossed Pennsylvania.      We stayed for a few days in Pittsburgh, where she seemed to rally enough to insist that we press on. I am sorry that I listened to her and did not follow my own instinct, which told me she needed more rest, but we were both anxious to reach Faithwell. Unfortunately within a day her fever had returned, this time accompanied by the black vomit and yellow tinge to her skin that I now know confirms yellow fever. It was only with great difficulty that I managed to convince the coachmen not to leave us by the side of the road, but continue on to Hudson. I am sorry to say that I had to shout at them, though it is not in a Friend's nature to do so. The other passengers would not allow us to sit inside for fear of contagion, and the coachmen made us perch on the luggage on top of the coach. It was very precarious, but I propped Grace against me and held tight to her so that she would not fall off.      In Hudson she lasted just a night before God called her home. For much of that time she was delirious, but a few hours before she died she became lucid for a little while, and was able to call out her love to each of you. I would have preferred to take her on to be laid to rest in Faithwell amongst Friends, but she has already been buried today in Hudson, for everyone is fearful of the infection spreading.      Since I am so close to Faithwell, I am determined to go on. It is only forty miles west of Hudson, which is no distance after the five hundred miles we came from New York and the thousands more across the ocean. It grieves me that Grace was so near to her new home, and now will never see it. I do not know what I will do when I get there. Adam Cox is not yet aware of this sorrowful news.     Grace suffered much and bore it bravely, but she is at peace now with God. I do know that one day we shall see her again, and that is some comfort.                                                          Your loving daughter and sister,                                                                                       Honor BrightEmbed",
