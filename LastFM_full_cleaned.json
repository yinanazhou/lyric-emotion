I've forgotten nuclear!   Ride a barrel down the falls Then cook spaghetti with meatballs Really make your friends amazed Nuke it with some gamma rays Fly to Venus in a rocket Put your finger in a socket You may suffer from exhaust But none of that energy is ever really lost  Then why can't we make a clean machine that moves perpetually? Cause there's another law with which all energy must agree Whenever it changes form, it loses quality   In other words...   Down/Damn that rising entropy!

She said, Soon have we begun, then she can have you But until then, you're mine.  I watch her hold to her course As an act of devotion And me, I'm riding high Going through Seems like every flash in her eye's An act of devotion And me I'm lost in her hands Going through the motions  Shore far away off the port side Shore far away off the bow Shore far away off the starboard side Shore far away from now",

His heart, it beats so fast; No sound, they moved on at last Timidly he wanders his way  The outcast, he enters their town Senseless hate haunts him now; The outcast with more feeling then they'll ever know  He only came for some food Maybe even company; Sometimes he feels so alone  He is the last one of his kind All his companions have died; Man signed their fatal destiny  His dreams tell him of ancient times Of wolves and men running side by side; How delightful freedom must have been  Wild woman's mate and totem-beast Idolized he was, but suddenly all changed; When the men with false dogmas came You call him the evil beast? But you are the real evil beast! You, who damned nature's dearest child  He cries his sorrow to the moon A tear shines through the misty gloom Can't you hear the last wolf's serenade?  They came wild and free Life in it's livery Stealing life from the land's living  Alone he sits by the lake His image in the lake his only friend Can't you hear the last wolf's serenade?

        "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time INT. FARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT FARAH, a beautiful Indian Princess, lies asleep in bed. Translucent curtains billow in the breeze. PRINCE  Most people think time is like a river that flows swift and sure in one direction. But I have seen the face of Time, and I can tell you... they are wrong. Farah awakens suddenly with a gasp.  PRINCE  Time is an ocean in a storm.  EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT  The PRINCE runs through a dense jungle, pushing aside leaves and branches. Grim determination on his face, as if he is on his way to save the world. In fact, he is.  As he runs, we hear his VOICE OVER:  PRINCE  You may wonder who I am and why I say this. Sit down, and I will tell you a tale like none that you have ever heard.  THE JUNGLE SKY  A FLAMING ARROW arcs high into the air.  EXT. INDIAN PALACE --- DAWN KING SHAHRAMAN, 70, watches from an atoll on horseback. Beside him is the Prince. Below, an Indian Palace is under attack by Persian soldiers.  PRINCE  Know, first, that I am the son of Shahraman, a mighty king of Persia. On our way to Azad with a small company of men, we passed through India...  Swords and horsemen clash in the driving rain, Persian soldiers against Indian soldiers. Catapults hurl flaming projectiles. Part of the palace is on fire.  EXT. INSIDE PALACE GATES --- DAWN  A richly dressed Indian VIZIER, an obvious villain, sneaks up on the Indian Soldier guarding the main gate.  PRINCE  Where the promise of honor and glory tempted my father into a grievous error. The Vizier draws a dagger, kills the startled soldier, and pulls the rope to open the gate.  EXT. INDIAN PALACE --- DAWN  The gate goes up. With a cry of triumph, the Persian soldiers swarm toward the open gate.  SHAHRAMAN Now, my son!  Shahraman's old eyes gleam with the lifelong love of war. Letting out a battle cry, he gallops down the hill. The young Prince gallops eagerly after him.  EXT. INSIDE PALACE GATES --- DAWN Persian soldiers storm through the courtyard, overwhelming the surprised Indian soldiers.  Shahraman and the Prince gallop to a stop before the Vizier, who welcomes them. Fighting continues around them.  VIZIER  Your Majesty, the Maharajah's treasure vaults lie within.  He points. The Prince's eyes follow his pointing finger to a burning wing of the palace.  VIZIER I trust you will remember your promise...?  That's all the Prince needs to hear. He spurs his horse and gallops off in the direction indicated by the Vizier.  SHAHRAMAN  See how he rides! Like a warrior's son.  EXT. PALACE COURTYARD --- DAWN  The Prince, on horseback, charges through the palace gates. Fires burn around him. Soldiers fight hand-to-hand, on horseback and on foot.  Enthralled by the sights of battle at close range, the Prince fails to notice the burning column behind him start to topple.  His horse jumps out of the way, just in time to avoid being crushed by the falling column. The Prince is thrown. Jumps to his feet, too late to catch his fleeing horse. He is on foot, in the midst of battle. He reaches for his dagger --- realizes he's lost it: his thigh holster is empty. Game Play : Indian Palace A setting of great drama and chaos, with parts of the palace burning and collapsing, and hand-to-hand combat raging between Indian and Persian soldiers. A cannonball blasts a hole in the palace wall. Entering, the Prince finds himself in the Maharajah's treasure vault. The sounds of battle recede; the Prince is alone. In the center of the room is a giant HOURGLASS that seems to radiate a mysterious power. Bypassing the hourglass, the Prince scales a giant elephant statue to reach the DAGGER OF TIME.  INT. TREASURE VAULT - MORNING  A sensuous close-up view of the DAGGER OF TIME. The jewels in the hilt gleam. Its blade is translucent.  The Prince approaches the dagger, takes it. Turns it in his hand; he is curious to notice that it contains sand.  PRINCE Sand...  VIEW FROM ABOVE  High above the Prince, a massive stone gargoyle teeters...and starts to fall.  THE PRINCE  Unaware of the stone gargoyle plunging toward him, he notices a switch on the dagger's hilt. He presses it. SAND spills from the dagger onto the floor.  At the last second, the Prince looks up to see the gargoyle about to crush him. His eyes widen with the terror of certain death. But just then ---  REWIND!  The gargoyle springs back up, reversing its trajectory, and lands in its original position.  THE PRINCE  blinks, baffled as to what just happened.  As he is staring up at the gargoyle, it teeters, just as it did before, and starts to fall a second time.  This time, forewarned, the Prince jumps back out of the way. The gargoyle crashes harmlessly next to him.  He looks at the dagger. He still doesn't understand what happened --- but he's going to keep it. He sheathes the dagger in his empty thigh holster.  Just then, the walls start to shake around him. The treasure vault is about to collapse.  Game Play : Indian Palace, continued The Prince runs for his life as the palace collapses around him, finally landing back in the Hourglass Room.  INT. HOURGLASS ROOM --- MORNING  The Prince dives and lands on the floor, covering his head with his arms to protect himself from falling debris.  When no more debris falls, he dares to lift his head... and finds himself confronted by a pair of royal boots, inches from his nose.  Looking up, he sees King Shahraman glaring down at him in disapproval. A most undignified position for a Prince.  The Prince saves the moment by quickly rolling to his feet, and proudly displaying the dagger. PRINCE Father, I have brought us honor and glory!  The Vizier is seized by a tubercular coughing fit that makes both Shahraman and the Prince look at him.  VIZIER  Your Majesty... You promised me my choice of the Maharajah's treasures.  That dagger...  The Prince protects the dagger possessively. Shahraman looks indulgent; he has a soft spot for his youngest son.  SHAHRAMAN Surely you won't deny the lad a souvenir of his first battle? You may have your choice of all the Maharajah's other treasures.  Except that hourglass.  WHIP PAN TO THE HOURGLASS, now being lifted with ropes by six Persian soldiers.  SHAHRAMAN  ...That will make a fine gift for the Sultan of Azad, when we pass through his city.  The Vizier's expression transforms into a look of hate. SHAHRAMAN  And some exotic animals for his menagerie... and a few dozen slave girls... Yes, that should be enough. I shall choose them myself. BEHIND A COLUMN  While Shahraman's speech continues, Farah, the beautiful young Indian girl from the first scene, peers around the column. Her large dark eyes widen with outrage. SHAHRAMAN   I want no animals or maidens harmed  until I have chosen! Let it be known King Shahraman is merciful in victory! A shadow passes over Farah. She whirls with a gasp to see TWO PERSIAN SOLDIERS standing menacingly behind her. On her terror-stricken face ---  CUT TO:  EXT. PERSIAN DESERT --- DAY  A magnificent royal procession of hundreds of men, horses and animals, crosses the white sands.  PRINCE  'Trust not a man who has betrayed his master, nor take him into your own service... lest he betray you too.'  Illustrate this by panning from a caged tiger to the Indian Vizier riding alongside.  PRINCE  I learned the truth of this, to my sorrow, the day that we arrived in Azad as the Sultan's honored guests. The next carriage contains veiled SLAVE GIRLS. Peering out through the slatted window is Farah, her eyes burning with determination. Though she has been captured as a slave girl, we sense she is not resigned to her fate.  CAMERA lingers on Farah a moment... then RISES to reveal the caravan's destination: the splendid PALACE OF AZAD.  INT. RECEPTION HALL --- NIGHT  A splendid royal hall, lined with Persian men and women. Guards stand at attention. The roly-poly SULTAN OF AZAD steps down from his throne to greet King Shahraman .  SHAHRAMAN AND SULTAN  My friend!  They embrace.  SULTAN Your visit brings joy and honor to my poor and humble dwelling. If only you had given me time to prepare a proper welcome!  SHAHRAMAN  The glories of Azad are famed throughout the world. One cannot improve on perfection. And yet, I hope that in your palace there may still be room for a few paltry gifts from India.  Shahraman gestures. TWO DOZEN SLAVE GIRLS step forward in unison and bow to the Sultan with a flourish.  As CAMERA RACES down the row of slave girls, one of them surreptitiously lifts her eyes: Farah.  Shahraman gestures again. The Sultan's eyes glitter with childlike anticipation as he turns to see...  ROARR!!! The Sultan jumps as a BENGAL TIGER strains his leash held by two Persian Guards. Two more tigers behind. The Sultan shivers pleasurably.  SULTAN Magnificent specimens. And so many gifts! I am quite speechless!  SHAHRAMAN Ah, the best is yet to come! I give you... The Sands of Time!  He turns, gestures with a flourish to the Hourglass. The velvet cloth covering it flies up, lifted to the ceiling by a rope.  SHAHRAMAN May the friendship between our kingdoms endure as long as Time itself!  The Sultan approaches the Hourglass, studies it with fascination. The Slave Girls retreat to the far end of the hall.  SULTAN The Sand... Why does it glow?  SHAHRAMAN  Er, um...  VIZIER  I can tell you.  Shahraman and the Sultan turn in surprise; it is the Indian Vizier who has spoken. He takes this opportunity to step forward, with a dry cough.  VIZIER Inside the hourglass is a marvel that no living man has seen.  The Sultan's eyes light up --- only to be disappointed when the Vizier adds:  VIZIER Alas, I cannot open it. Only the Dagger can unlock the Sands of Time... and it belongs to a greater one than I.  He points suddenly to the Prince --- who is discomfited to find himself the center of attention.  VIZIER A young Prince dearer to his father than all the wealth of India. Perhaps he will oblige...?  Farah's eyes widen with horror as she sees ---  HER POV: FAST TRACK-IN, THE LENGTH OF THE HALL, TO CLOSE-UP OF THE DAGGER on the Prince's thigh.  FARAH No!  THE PRINCE,  happy to oblige, draws the dagger.  FARAH  rushes toward him. But there's a lot of distance to cover.  FARAH No! Stop!  THE PRINCE  Too far away to notice Farah, he steps to the hourglass, thrusts the dagger into the slot provided for that purpose, and twists it --- instantly triggering TIME-BLUR SLOW-MOTION EFFECT.  FARAH  running toward him, in slow motion...  FARAH NOOOOO!!!!  THE PRINCE  becomes aware of Farah's distorted cry. In slow motion, he turns, sees her running toward him...  As suddenly as it started, END TIME-BLUR SLOW-MOTION EFFECT.  Sand pours out of the hourglass onto the floor. The sand is bright white, almost glowing.  Farah stops running. It's too late.  Shahraman, the Sultan and Vizier stare at the flowing sand. The Vizier's eyes gleam with joyful expectation.  The room begins to shake.  Worried eyes rise to the vaulted ceiling as the shaking increases. Dust and bits of stone rain down.  The Sands of Time creep along the floor, slowly, like a dryice fog. The Prince looks down uneasily as the sand swirls around his feet, Shahraman's and the Vizier's.  The sand cloud rises around the Vizier. He takes a step back, raising his staff, and speaks imperious words of command in a foreign tongue:  VIZIER  'Sands of Time, Back!'  The ornament on the Vizier's staff FLASHES, repelling the sand cloud. Others in the room are not so lucky.  The Sultan shrinks uncomfortably from the sand cloud rising around him. Looks to Shahraman for reassurance.  SULTAN Is it meant to do this?  KING SHAHRAMAN  sees the Sands creeping up his legs. He tries to push it away, then draws his sword, trying to fight it. The sand  sucks the water from his body, transforming him into a hideous SANDMAN. A WOMAN SCREAMS.  PRINCE FATHER!!!  In quick succession, the Sultan and his two nearest BODYGUARDS are likewise transformed into Sandmen.  SCREAMING MEN AND WOMEN  run from the pursuing sands, as chunks of stone rain down from the ceiling. Farah among them.  THE PRINCE  looks down in confusion at himself. Why has he been spared? His Dagger is glowing, repelling the sand cloud, just as the Vizier's ornament did.  THE VIZIER  steps toward the Prince. Stretches out his hand.  VIZIER Give me the dagger!  PRINCE  No!!  VIZIER You have unleashed the Sands of Time. I can undo what you have done. Give it to me!  The Prince backs away in horror, shaking his head... Game Play : Royal Chambers As the Prince tries to escape, he is repeatedly attacked by hosts of Sandmen--the palace's inhabitants, transformed by Sands of Time into hideous monsters. The Dagger proves essential to his survival, since it is the only weapon that can vanquish them.  INT. PASSAGEWAY --- NIGHT  Farah grabs the Prince by the hand and yanks him into the passageway; the door slams shut behind them, sealing out a snarling Sandman. Farah faces the startled Prince. She puts her hand out.  FARAH Give me the Dagger.  The Prince stares at her for a moment. Sands of Time are swirling in the air around both of them; so why is she spared? Her MEDALLION is glowing, repelling the sand cloud. Like his dagger. Like the Vizier's staff.  The Prince pushes Farah against the wall. His eyes are wild and traumatized.  PRINCE Who are you?  FARAH I am Farah, the daughter of the Maharajah from whom you stole it. This is your doing.  PRINCE  I saw my father turned to sand!  FARAH And we will share his fate, if you do not give me the Dagger, to undo what you have done!  PRINCE Your traitorous Vizier used the same words.  From now on, I trust no one but myself. With a terrifying ROAR, TWO SANDMEN land nearby. Farah shrinks back in fear, as the Prince draws his sword.  PRINCE Run!  Farah doesn't need to be told twice. She scrambles through a crack in the wall. The Prince tries to follow, but is too big to fit. Giving up, he turns to face the Sandmen.  Farah's frightened eyes peer at him from the other side of the crack.  PRINCE Go back to the reception hall; wait for me there. GO!!!  And blocks a mighty blow as the Sandmen attack him. Game Play : Royal Chambers En route to the reception hall, the Prince helps a guard activate the palace's military defense system.  INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT  As the Prince throws his lever, the Guard simultaneously throws his. The DEFENSE MECHANISM rumbles to life.  SERIES OF QUICK CUTS showing traps activating in different locations throughout the palace:  QUICK CUT --- A PORTCULLIS  slams shut.  QUICK CUT --- SPIKES  spring out of the floor, skewering a Sandman, who explodes into a cloud of sand.  QUICK CUT --- ANOTHER PORTCULLIS  slams shut.  QUICK CUT --- BLADES  whip out of the wall, then retract, passing so close to the camera that it shakes.  INT. CONTROL ROOM --- NIGHT  The defense mechanism finishes its work, and comes to a stop. The Prince and Guard stand watching it. Game Play : Royal Chambers The Prince soon regrets having activated the defense system, as it makes his progress through the palace much more dangerous.  INT. RECEPTION HALL --- NIGHT  The Prince appears on a balcony overlooking the Reception Hall. He sees Farah surrounded by an army of menacing SAND PEOPLE.  PRINCE Farah!!  She looks up at him... then returns her attention to the desperate fight. Reloading her bow, she shoots arrow after arrow.  One SAND GUARD takes an arrow in the chest... and keeps on coming.  THE PRINCE  jumps off the balcony, does a spectacular walling and rebound to land between Farah and the Sand People. He draws his sword and dagger.  PRINCE Farah, get back!  Game Play : Reception Hall The Prince fights the sand creatures, with Farah's help, until only four are left.  INT. RECEPTION ROOM --- NIGHT  The Prince turns to face the new enemies.  THE FOUR ENEMIES  step forward. Three of them wear the uniforms of King Shahraman's personal bodyguards. The fourth wears the uniform of Shahraman himself.  He is THE SAND KING.  FARAH AND THE PRINCE  gasp in horror.  PRINCE FATHER!!  THE SAND KING  GROWLS... a hideous, inhuman sound. Though he resembles King Shahraman, he shows absolutely no recognition of his son. His face is as cold and dead as that of any sand creature. He steps forward to fight the Prince.  Game Play : Reception Hall The Prince fights and kills the Sand King.  INT. RECEPTION HALL --- NIGHT  The Prince and the Sand King SCREAM together in rage and pain as sand flows from the Sand King into the Prince`s dagger. And then it's over.  WIDE SHOT - HIGH ANGLE  The great hall, empty of enemies. The Prince falls to his knees and stays there.  Farah, at a distance, approaches him timidly.   THE PRINCE  On his knees, grieving.  Farah comes up behind him. Hesitant, awkward.  FARAH I'm sorry.  At first it seems the Prince has not heard her. Then, he speaks without turning. His voice is expressionless.  PRINCE Why?  FARAH  I know what it is to lose a father.  Now the Prince turns. His eyes are like ice.  PRINCE That was not my father.  He stands. Sheathes his sword and dagger.  He turns. Sees the VORTEX that has formed behind them.  His eyes narrow in determination. He strides toward the vortex. Farah is terrified. To her it looks like he's about to commit suicide.  FARAH What are you doing?... Wait! STOP!!  Ignoring her, the Prince PLUNGES into the Vortex. He lets out a cry of pleasure and pain as huge quantities of sand flow into his dagger from all sides.  WHAM!! The Prince finds himself levitated a meter off the floor, in fetal position. Farah stares in astonishment.  EXT. PALACE --- DAY   Establishing shot of the palace. Camera zeroes in on the TOWER OF DAWN, flies toward it at increasing speed, and into a window...  INT. TREASURE VAULT --- DAY   The SAND GRIFFIN's great wings flap slowly as it lowers the Hourglass into the center of the room. The Vizier stands nearby, supervising this operation.  EXT. TOWER OF DAWN --- DAY   The Sand Griffin flies out the window and glides down in spirals toward earth.  END VISION.  INT. RECEPTION HALL --- NIGHT  The Prince, curled up in fetal position on the cold marble floor, awakens. A shadow passes over him. He looks up...  And snatches the Dagger from the floor where it fell, moments before Farah is able to grab it. The Prince rolls to his feet. Farah is caught red-handed.  PRINCE So! This is the thanks I get for saving your life!  FARAH You don't understand! I need that Dagger, to undo ---  PRINCE 'To undo what I have done.' Truly, you must think I am a fool!  FARAH You are right to be cautious. But fight as bravely as you may, you cannot defeat this enemy. The Sands will spread. They will consume... everything. She lays her hand on his arm. Her big, dark eyes look straight into his. The Prince weakens.  FARAH I have heard it said that you are kind as well as brave. Please believe me. Help me find the Hourglass.  PRINCE  It is in the Sultan's treasure vault atop the Tower of Dawn.  FARAH How do you know that?  PRINCE I just know. Come with me, then, if you insist. But I warn you, I move pretty fast. You'd better keep up.  Farah is already running off. She climbs out the broken window and drops from sight.  EXT. PALACE --- NIGHT  Farah runs and jumps along the rocks, quick and agile.  Behind Farah, the Prince emerges from the hole in the palace wall. Farah turns, beckons for the Prince to follow.  FARAH Come on! Game Play : Zoo / Barracks Together, the Prince and Farah make their way through the moonlit ruins of the Sultan's fabled zoo. In the darkness prowl Sand Tigers and other frightening beasts, whom the Prince must fight. Escaping from the zoo, they pass through the military barracks, and emerge onto a bridge. EXT. BRIDGE --- NIGHT  A concrete bridge extends between two towers, a garden far below. Farah and the Prince appear at one end.  PRINCE This way!  CAMERA does a 180deg, showing a portcullis open at the other end of the bridge. The Prince runs INTO SHOT, across the bridge, Farah right behind him.  FARAH  A shadow passes over her. She stops. Looks up ---  FARAH  Look out!!  Warned, the Prince turns; dives out of the way just in time to avoid being clipped by the Sand Griffin's wing. The blow SHATTERS the bridge between them, creating an 8m gap. Farah scrambles to safety on her side of the gap. The Prince rolls to his feet and draws his sword, as the Sand Griffin circles and flies back toward him... Game Play : Broken Bridge The Prince fights off the Sand Griffin, and is again rewarded with a vision. INT. CISTERNS --- NIGHT   DESCENDING into a water chute...  MOVING through cavern passageways...  DRIFTING across the surface of a vast water tank...  SAND EUNUCHS AND COURTESANS, a terrifying vision, turn in unison to face us...  EXT. BROKEN BRIDGE --- NIGHT  Farah comes into focus on the other side of the bridge. Her voice seems to come from a great distance.  FARAH Wake up! Please wake up!  The Prince, lying on the ground, stirs. Gets up.  FARAH  Your arm!  The Prince looks at his left arm --- it's bare and bleeding, the sleeve partially torn off by the Sand Griffin's claws. He tears off the sleeve and tosses it away. He extends one arm to Farah.  PRINCE Farah, jump!  Their eyes meet. Farah trusts him. She jumps.  At the last moment, the Prince catches her by the arm. Farah hangs struggling in space...  WIDE SHOT  showing the two small figures hanging precariously from the broken bridge. Vertigo!  FARAH AND PRINCE  The Prince pulls Farah up to safety.  As he does, their faces are brought close together. For a moment it seems the Prince might kiss her... or say something nice... A MECHANICAL NOISE behind them. The Prince turns to see the portcullis starting to close.  Game Play : Broken Bridge The Prince and Farah sprint along the bridge toward the closing gate.  EXT. BROKEN BRIDGE --- NIGHT  Farah reaches the slowly descending portcullis first; ducks under it. Turning, she shouts to the Prince, who is still running:  FARAH I'll raise the gate for you!  She steps to the wall; grabs a lever ---  The Prince guesses what's about to happen. Sprinting toward the gate, he shouts ---  PRINCE NO!!  Too late. Farah throws the lever. Instantly, the gate SLAMS SHUT in the Prince's face just as he reaches it.  Farah throws the lever again. It does nothing. The Prince glares at her through the bars.  PRINCE You go on down. I'll find another way in.  Farah gives him a look of humiliation... then turns and runs off into the tower, until she has disappeared from sight. Game Play : Ext. Tower / Int. Baths With some difficulty, the Prince rejoins Farah in the royal baths just in time to save her from a bevy of Sand Eunuchs and Sand Courtesans.  INT. HAREM --- MORNING  A BLUR gradually comes into focus, becomes Farah  stroking the Prince's hair. He is lying on the tiled floor with his head in her lap.  FARAH  Don't leave me... My love... Please don't leave me.  The Prince's eyes flicker open.  PRINCE What did you call me?  Embarassed at having revealed her feelings, Farah briskly jumps to her feet, allowing the Prince's head to bang against the tiled floor.  FARAH It doesn't matter. The important thing is, I know how we can reach the Tower of Dawn.  PRINCE  Of course. The hourglass.  FARAH You said it was in the Sultan's treasure vault atop the tower. I hope you're right. It takes two to lower the bridge. One at the top of each watchtower.  PRINCE How do you know?  Farah's big brown eyes gaze innocently into his.  FARAH 'I just know.'  The Prince is uncertain whether she is making fun of him.  PRINCE All right. But this time, stay with me, and pay attention. I can't spend all day chasing after you.  Farah looks like she wants to make an angry retort. But the Prince is already moving on. Game Play : Hall of Learning / Barracks Farah and the Prince solve the mirror puzzle of the Hall of Learning, and escape onto the ramparts that connect the two watchtowers. The Prince sees Farah safely into her watchtower. He himself is not so lucky.  EXT. RAMPARTS --- DAY  As the Prince runs, the stone floor starts to crumble beneath his feet.  He turns, runs back. Too late. Falling, he tries to grab the crumbling ledge. It breaks away.  He plunges into the darkness of a stone shaft. A rain of rocks accompanies him. Falling past a ledge, he tries to grab it; his fingers slide off.  INT. DUNGEON --- DAY  WHAM! The Prince hits the stone floor. As he is getting up, a ROCK falls on his back, knocking him flat.  FADE TO BLACK.  FADE IN:  The Prince opens his eyes. He is in a dungeon, amid debris. Daylight streams in through a small barred window. And through the hole in the ceiling, high above.  Painfully, the Prince sits up. Rubs his head. He winces as he rises to his feet.  Grimly, he strips off his other torn sleeve; tosses it aside. Game Play : Prison / Forge / Barracks The Prince escapes from the dungeon, and uses a catapult to smash his way into the watchtower. As he throws his lever, Farah, in the other watchtower, throws hers... lowering the bridge to the Tower of Dawn.  EXT. TOWER OF DAWN --- DAY  As Farah and the Prince run across the bridge...  WHAM!!! The bridge shakes as the Sand Griffin lands, barring their way.  Farah backs away, drawing her bow. The Prince draws his sword to fight. The Sand Griffin bats him with a powerful wing, sending him flying back into the courtyard.  EXT. COURTYARD --- DAY The Prince lands, stunned. WHAM! The Sand Griffin lands in front of him.  The Prince gets warily to his feet. It's going to be a fight, and one he really isn't looking forward to.  FARAH Be careful! Game Play : Tower of Dawn Courtyard The Prince defeats the Sand Griffin and is again rewarded with a vision.  EXT. TOWER OF DAWN --- DAY  The Prince trembles as huge quantities of sand flow into the dagger from all sides. The dagger glows with a bright light.  INT. TOMB --- NIGHT   Farah looms into view, cold determination in her eyes. She reaches toward CAMERA...  THE DAGGER  lies beside a heap of the Prince's clothes, sword and sandals. Farah reaches for it...  EXT. TOWER OF DAWN --- DAY  The Prince awakens to find his head in Farah's lap; she is tenderly stroking his hair. In a flash he draws his dagger, scrambling to his feet. He faces her like an enemy. His eyes are wild with paranoia.  FARAH It's all right! It's me!  Confused, the Prince looks at the dagger in his hand. If she wanted to take it, she could have.  FARAH  It's me!  The Prince hesitates... then pockets the dagger. Farah takes his hand, guides him toward the open gate of the next room.  FARAH Look! At last we're here! The Tower of Dawn! Eagerly, she runs past him toward the open door. The Prince looks after her suspiciously. His visions have never lied to him before... Game Play : Tower of Dawn The Prince and Farah reach the treasure vault at the top of the Tower of Dawn, where the Vizier has brought the Hourglass.  INT. HOURGLASS VAULT --- DAY  The Prince lands on top of the hourglass. Farah, excited, calls to him from below.  FARAH You did it! Do you see the dome atop the hourglass?  The Prince looks. Sees the bubble of a glass dome just as she described it.  FARAH Take the dagger. Strike it into the center of the dome!  The Prince draws his dagger, ready to obey. He looks at Farah ---  QUICK CUT --- VISION FLASHBACK  Farah looms into view, cold determination in her eyes, reaching toward camera...  BACK TO SCENE  The Prince looks at the dagger in his hand. Looks down at Farah; she is standing below, looking up at him.  PRINCE  Why does the Vizier want the dagger?  FARAH What? Go on --- do it!  The Prince hesitates. He lowers the dagger.  PRINCE You have every reason to hate me.  FARAH What are you talking about?  PRINCE My father's army sacked your palace... captured you as a slave. Now you want me to trust you.  FARAH  Please. There's no time!  The Prince turns. Farah turns. CAMERA WHIPS following their gaze to ---  THE VIZIER  stands in the entrance to the Hourglass Room. His eyes blaze. He raises his staff, a terrifying sorcerer.  VIZIER  'Winds of the desert, blow! Blow! Blow!!'  Even as he speaks, WIND stirs the room...  THE PRINCE  atop the hourglass, is suddenly BLOWN across the room. Hits the wall, sprawls on the floor under a window. He's missed his chance.  FARAH  NOOOO!!!!  THE VIZIER  His staff ornament GLOWS, a nimbus of wizardly light protecting him from the howling winds and blowing SAND. He advances on the Prince. Stretches out his hand.  VIZIER Give me the dagger!  FARAH  grabs hold of a pillar, clings to it desperately. But the wind is too strong; it breaks her grip. With a cry, she sails across the room.  The Prince lunges, grabs her hand just in time to save her from being blown out the window. With his other hand, he grasps a pillar.  FARAH  The dagger! He must not get the dagger!  The Vizier advances determinedly. As he reaches out for his prize, the Prince suddenly lets go of the pillar. The surprised Vizier's hand closes on empty air, as the Prince and Farah fly out the window. Game Play : Sandstorm Blown across the parapets by the howling sandstorm, the Prince and Farah manage to find shelter.  INT. TOMB --- DAY   The door SHUTS behind the Prince and Farah, sealing out the howling winds. TORCHES flame on, illuminating a mausoleum.  The Prince's gaze flies to the stone slab in the center of the room. His eyes widen in superstious fear.  PRINCE A tomb! Farah whirls to face the Prince in bewildered anger. All is lost now --- and it's his fault.  FARAH You were there! The dagger was in your hand! Why did you hesitate?  The Prince has no reply. He knows he screwed up.  FARAH You think you're cleverer than everybody. But you're just like the rest of them... those soldiers... All they can do is fight, destroy. Why did I trust you?!?  The Prince slumps down onto the tomb, head in hands. His despair is obvious.  Farah sees his distress. Her eyes fill. She sits beside him, places her hand tenderly on his shoulder.  FARAH  Why didn't you trust me? The Prince looks up at her.  Farah looks back at him as if she wants to be kissed. She has never been more beautiful.  As if in a dream, the Prince leans toward her...  THE TORCHES GO OUT. TOTAL BLACKNESS. Scuffling sounds.  FARAH Ow!  PRINCE Sorry.  More scuffling sounds.  FARAH  Where are you?!  PRINCE I'm right here.  FARAH Hold my hand. Don't let go.  Silence. Nestling sounds. Breathing.  FARAH I didn't mean what I said.  PRINCE  No, you're right. All that's happened is my doing. I wanted honor and glory... I brought this on us.  In the darkness Farah puts her arms around him, holds him.  FARAH You are brave and good. If this tomb is to be ours... at least the Dagger will be buried with us. And... we are together.  In the silence...  FARAH What is it?  PRINCE Nothing.  FARAH You're trembling!  PRINCE  I just don't like close spaces. There must be some way out of here.  Silence.  FARAH When I was small, my mother taught me a secret word. She said that when I was afraid, all I had to do was speak that word and a magic door would open.  I've never told that to anybody.  PRINCE I can see why. It's the most childish thing I've ever heard of.  What was the word? FARAH  'Kakolookiyam.'  As she says the words, there is a noise like stone sliding against stone. More scuffling sounds.  PRINCE  You did that. Didn't you?  No reply.  PRINCE  Farah?  The TORCHES ILLUMINATE again, revealing the room. The Prince is alone. The slab has been moved. Game Play : Magic Cavern In a dreamlike sequence, the Prince descends a flight of stairs into the tomb, and finds Farah in a place that is not quite real.  INT. MAGIC CAVERN Farah is already in the room, staring with delight at something off-camera. As the Prince comes up beside her, she takes his hand.  FARAH It's beautiful.  They both stand there staring at the same incredible sight. Farah grins suddenly with childlike delight. She runs offscreen. We HEAR A SPLASH.  FARAH IN THE POOL  Farah surfaces in a tiled pool, from which steam rises invitingly.  FARAH Come on!  THE PRINCE  advances in disbelief, taking in their surroundings.  A table with a jug of wine and fresh fruit. A luxurious bed with silk pillows and draperies. Hundreds of lit candles illuminate a room fit for a prince and princess's honeymoon.  The Prince descends the tiled steps into the pool. As he approaches, Farah swims backward, treading water. A slight teasing smile on her lips.  As the Prince exits frame, HOLD on the empty wall. The flickering candlelight casts SILHOUETTES of Farah and the Prince on the wall.  SILHOUETTES ON THE WALL  The Prince advances, waist-high in the water. Farah treads water with only her head visible.  Then Farah stands. Faces the Prince. Takes off whatever she's wearing. We only see their shadows.  PRINCE  Kakolookiyam.  The shadows embrace, kiss.  FADE OUT.  INT. TOMB --- DAY   The Prince awakens with a start, as if from a dream. As he looks around the room, his eyes fall on ---  His clothing and sandals, in a heap on the floor. No dagger. And no sword.  It was no dream. Game Play : Tomb In the cold light of morning, the tomb is just a plain mausoleum, with no magic stairway. Farah is gone. The Prince finds the way out. EXT. SAND DRIFT --- DAY  The Prince climbs out of a sand drift; shakes off sand. He stands there blinking incredulously into the bright daylight.  WHAT HE SEES  PANORAMIC VIEW of the entire palace buried in sand. Only the highest minarets, including the upper part of the Tower of Dawn, are visible. The rest is buried.  THE PRINCE  The SHRIEK of a Sand Bird attracts his attention. He looks up to see Farah climbing the Tower of Dawn with grim determination. She holds the Prince's dagger in one hand, his old sword --- too heavy for her --- in the other.  PRINCE Farah! No!  She glances back over her shoulder --- then climbs on, ignoring him. SAND BIRDS circle her like vultures. Game Play : Tower of Dawn Beset by Sand Birds, the Prince climbs the tower after Farah, and finds a magic sword to replace the one she stole. Though handicapped by not having the dagger, he manages to reach the top of the tower... EXT. TOWER OF DAWN ROOFTOP - DAY  Farah faces the Sand Giffin.  The Dagger in one hand, she awkwardly swings the heavy sword with the other. The Griffin SNARLS; lunges at her. Farah holds it off.  THE PRINCE  reaches the top and is horrified by the sight.  PRINCE FARAH!!  Farah turns at the sound of his voice. The Griffin strikes her a mighty blow with its claw, knocking the sword from her hand and smashing a hole in the roof.  The roof caves in beneath Farah's feet. As she falls, she manages to grab the edge of the hole. She still has the Dagger.  The Prince runs toward her...  Farah desperately tries to climb back up to safety...  Just as the Prince reaches Farah, a large chunk of roof breaks off and she falls. The Prince lunges and grabs the dagger in her hand --- by the blade.  The Prince grimaces with determination. His grip tightens on the blade; he is bearing Farah's entire weight. That's got to hurt.  A thin line of blood trickles from his fist. A drop lands on Farah's cheek.  She looks at him. In her eyes we see love, understanding... and, finally, peace.  FARAH  Kakolookiyam.  PRINCE Farah, no!  She lets go of the dagger. And falls.  The Prince scrambles to the edge of the hole. Looks down. His expression is pure horror.  WHAT HE SEES: Farah lying dead at the bottom of the hole, far below in the Hourglass Room. A drop of blood on her cheek.  THE SAND GRIFFIN  strikes the Prince from behind, sending him sprawling. With a snarl, the monster advances on him.  The Prince's expression transforms to grim determination. Drawing his sword, he rises to his feet to face the Sand Griffin. This is going to be the fight of his life.  Game Play : Tower of Dawn The Prince defeats the Sand Griffin for the last time, and descends into the Hourglass Room...  INT. HOURGLASS ROOM --- DAY  Farah lies motionless amid the debris of the fallen rooftop. The Prince rushes to her side, lifts her in his arms. She is dead.  PRINCE No. No.  Lost in grief, the Prince fails to notice the shadow passing over him, as the Vizier steals up on him from behind...  The Prince whirls with lightning speed. Before the Vizier can strike, the Prince snatches his staff and flings it away. In an instant the Vizier is flat on his back, the Prince crouched over him like a tiger, eyes blazing, dagger raised to kill.  VIZIER  The girl... is unimportant. Give me the dagger... and I will give you power such as no king since  Suleyman has dreamed of. Eternal Life... will be yours.  The Prince's eyes narrow with hatred.  PRINCE Live forever... when those I loved are dead, and I to blame! I choose Death.  The Vizier gleams with anticipation, fully expecting the Prince to strike the dagger into his heart. Oddly, this prospect seems to fill the Vizier not with fear, but exaltation. But before we can wonder why...  Instead of striking the fatal blow, the Prince vaults off the Vizier and runs up the wall, from which he executes a brilliant rebound, landing on top of the hourglass.  Standing atop the hourglass, the Prince raises the dagger high, blazing with determination.  The Vizier realizes what's about to happen. His eyes go wide with terror ---  VIZIER NO!!!!!!  The Prince PLUNGES the dagger into the center of the sun. A BLINDING BURST OF LIGHT. Like a nuclear blast.  THE BIGGEST REWIND OF ALL.  PRINCE  Bravely I had fought, and slain my enemies. Honor and glory were mine. But though I fight until the desert sands themselves were red with blood... I could not bring back the dead. It starts out slow: the dagger comes up out of the hourglass, the Prince reverses his jump and walling move...  ...then faster: Farah rises up out of the caved-in roof, which reassembles...  ...Faster and faster, a jumble of fragmented images from the game, hours now compressed into seconds...  ...at last slowing again to viewable speed, as the Prince gallops backwards through a battle between Indian and Persian soldiers...  INT. FARAH'S BEDROOM --- NIGHT  Farah awakens in bed with a gasp.  INT. TENT --- NIGHT  At the same instant, the Prince is likewise startled awake.  Clutched in his hand is the Dagger. He looks at it as if seeing it for the first time. Then looks around, getting his bearings. He is in a small tent. NIGHT SOUNDS.  EXT. MILITARY ENCAMPMENT --- NIGHT  The Prince emerges from his tent and looks around.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL that his tent is one of a hundred like it. The Persian Army is camped on an Indian plain. We see horses tied up, a few Persian soldiers on guard. The rest of the army is asleep in their tents.  Hearing voices, the Prince sneaks up on a larger tent nearby, and eavesdrops. We SEE SHADOWS of Shahraman and a Soldier inside.  SOLDIER  ...And at dawn, we march.  SHAHRAMAN  A great deal depends upon this traitor. If he should fail?  SOLDIER  Your Majesty, he will signal with a flaming arrow shot into the air. When we see it, we attack. And not before.  The Prince backs away from the tent... turns, and runs off into the night.  EXT. JUNGLE --- NIGHT  The PRINCE runs through a dense jungle, pushing aside branches. Grim determination is on his face, as if he is on his way to save the world. In fact, he is.  The Prince reaches the edge of the jungle, and pauses, pushing aside leaves...  WHAT HE SEES  The Maharajah's palace compound, lying just beyond the edge of the jungle.  INT. FARAH'S BEDROOM --- NIGHT  Farah, awakened, gets out of bed in her nightgown. Pushing aside the translucent curtains, she walks to the edge of her balcony and looks out. NIGHT SOUNDS.  WHAT SHE SEES  The edge of the jungle .  FARAH  Hearing a sound, she whirls suddenly with a frightened gasp to see the Prince standing on her balcony.  PRINCE Do not be afraid.  Farah shrinks back as the Prince advances on her. She is very much afraid --- but her expression suggests that if he attacks her, she'll fight back anyway.  Her eyes widen in fear as the Prince draws a dagger. To her surprise, instead of attacking, he offers it to her, handle first.  PRINCE This belongs to you.  Farah looks at the dagger. To her confusion, she recognizes it. Her hand flies unconsciously to touch the medallion at her throat, an instinctive gesture.  FARAH The Dagger of Time! But it is locked away within my father's treasure vault! How ---  PRINCE Most people think time is like a river that flows swift and sure in one direction. But I have seen the face of Time, and I can tell you... they are wrong. Time is an ocean in a storm.  Farah looks at him with the first sign of interest.  PRINCE  You may wonder who I am and why I say this. Sit down, and I will tell you a tale like none that you have ever heard.  Farah sits down on a pillow. On her listening face, DISSOLVE TO...  EXT. MAHARAJAH'S PALACE --- DAWN  As the Prince's talking voice fades out, we HEAR PRINCE'S VOICE-OVER, as we have heard it throughout the game:  PRINCE  ...And that is why I have come. To warn you and your father to arrest this treacherous Vizier before he betrays you, and brings ruin on us all.  INT. FARAH'S BEDROOM --- DAWN  Farah sits listening to the Prince finish his story, which has taken him all night to tell.  PRINCE His signal is a flaming arrow shot into the air. Prevent him, and my father's army will know the traitor has been unmasked. They will turn back.  His voice and expression plead with her to believe him. Farah still seems undecided... Then, a DRY COUGH from the shadows makes them both turn.  VIZIER A wild tale, indeed. I have a simpler version.  The Vizier steps out of the shadows.  VIZIER A Persian soldier, lusting for glory, entered the chambers of the Maharajah's daughter and was slain --- by me.  Magic staff in hand, the Vizier advances menacingly toward the Prince. The Prince scowls. Draws his sword.  Game Play : Farah's Bedroom The Vizier attacks the Prince using magic. The Prince defends himself with a sword. The battle ends outside on the balcony.  EXT. EDGE OF JUNGLE --- DAWN  The Vizier staggers, mortally wounded. With a baffled expression on his face, he crumples to his knees.  VIZIER I could have been... immortal.  And he falls. The Prince stands there, sword in hand, a weary warrior. He turns to see Farah staring in wonderment.  FARAH Then it's true. He was a traitor.  PRINCE  Take this. Return it to your father's treasure vault. Guard it well.  Farah does not reach for it.  FARAH  I owe you thanks. But why did you invent such a fantastic story? Do you think me a child, that I would believe such nonsense?  Frustrated, the Prince grabs Farah in his arms and gives her a passionate kiss. She struggles against him, finally escapes with a violent shove.  FARAH  I said I owe you thanks. You presume too much.  The Prince looks resigned. Before Farah's eyes, he lifts the dagger... and PRESSES THE REWIND SWITCH.  FAST REWIND, reversing the kiss, and stopping on ---  FARAH  ...such a fantastic story? Do you think me a child, that I would believe such nonsense?  The Prince sighs: he'll never convince her. In his eyes is a new maturity, tinged with gentle regret. He places the dagger into her hands.  PRINCE You're right. It was just a story.  Farah looks relieved. The Prince turns to head back into the jungle. As he climbs up onto a giant fallen tree --  FARAH Wait!  I don't even know your name.  The Prince hesitates. Then inspiration strikes.  PRINCE Just call me... Kakolookiyam!  With a wink, he jumps down, and vanishes into the jungle.  FARAH  wonders: How could he possibly have known that?  She wrestles with it. Giving up, she turns away... Looks down at the dagger in her hands... Then looks back. A doubt in her eyes.  As she debates, we PULL BACK until Farah is just a small figure standing at the edge of the clearing... Behind her, the safety of the palace; before her, the vast impenetrable darkness of the jungle.  ROLL END CREDITS.6",

A pig is an animal with dirt on his face His shoes are a terrible disgrace He has no manners when he eats his food He's fat and lazy and extremely rude But if you don't care a feather or a fig You may grow up to be a pig  Or would you like to swing on a star Carry moonbeams home in a jar And be better off than you are Or would you rather be a fish?   A fish won't do anything, but swim in a brook He can't write his name or read a book To fool the people is his only thought And though he's slippery, he still gets caught But then if that sort of life is what you wish You may grow up to be a fish  A new kind of jumped up slippery fish   And all the monkeys aren't in the zoo Everyday you'll meet quite a few So you see it's all up to you  You can be better than you are  You could be swingin' on a star  Doo doo doo doo doo Doo doo doo doo doo, doo doo",

        "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow Found among the papers of the late Diedrich Knickerbocker.  A pleasing land of drowsy head it was, Of dreams that wave before the half-shut eye; And of gay castles in the clouds that pass, Forever flushing round a summer sky. - Castle of Indolence In the bosom of one of those spacious coves which indent the eastern shore of the Hudson, at that broad expansion of the river denominated by the ancient Dutch navigators the Tappan Zee, and where they always prudently shortened sail and implored the protection of St. Nicholas when they crossed, there lies a small market town or rural port, which by some is called Greensburgh, but which is more generally and properly known by the name of Tarry Town. This name was given, we are told, in former days, by the good housewives of the adjacent country, from the inveterate propensity of their husbands to linger about the village tavern on market days. Be that as it may, I do not vouch for the fact, but merely advert to it, for the sake of being precise and authentic. Not far from this village, perhaps about two miles, there is a little valley or rather lap of land among high hills, which is one of the quietest places in the whole world. A small brook glides through it, with just murmur enough to lull one to repose; and the occasional whistle of a quail or tapping of a woodpecker is almost the only sound that ever breaks in upon the uniform tranquillity.  I recollect that, when a stripling, my first exploit in squirrel-shooting was in a grove of tall walnut-trees that shades one side of the valley. I had wandered into it at noontime, when all nature is peculiarly quiet, and was startled by the roar of my own gun, as it broke the Sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes. If ever I should wish for a retreat whither I might steal from the world and its distractions, and dream quietly away the remnant of a troubled life, I know of none more promising than this little valley.  From the listless repose of the place, and the peculiar character of its inhabitants, who are descendants from the original Dutch settlers, this sequestered glen has long been known by the name of SLEEPY HOLLOW, and its rustic lads are called the Sleepy Hollow Boys throughout all the neighboring country. A drowsy, dreamy influence seems to hang over the land, and to pervade the very atmosphere. Some say that the place was bewitched by a high German doctor, during the early days of the settlement; others, that an old Indian chief, the prophet or wizard of his tribe, held his powwows there before the country was discovered by Master Hendrick Hudson. Certain it is, the place still continues under the sway of some witching power, that holds a spell over the minds of the good people, causing them to walk in a continual reverie. They are given to all kinds of marvellous beliefs, are subject to trances and visions, and frequently see strange sights, and hear music and voices in the air. The whole neighborhood abounds with local tales, haunted spots, and twilight superstitions; stars shoot and meteors glare oftener across the valley than in any other part of the country, and the nightmare, with her whole ninefold, seems to make it the favorite scene of her gambols.  The dominant spirit, however, that haunts this enchanted region, and seems to be commander-in-chief of all the powers of the air, is the apparition of a figure on horseback, without a head. It is said by some to be the ghost of a Hessian trooper, whose head had been carried away by a cannon-ball, in some nameless battle during the Revolutionary War, and who is ever and anon seen by the country folk hurrying along in the gloom of night, as if on the wings of the wind. His haunts are not confined to the valley, but extend at times to the adjacent roads, and especially to the vicinity of a church at no great distance. Indeed, certain of the most authentic historians of those parts, who have been careful in collecting and collating the floating facts concerning this spectre, allege that the body of the trooper having been buried in the churchyard, the ghost rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly quest of his head, and that the rushing speed with which he sometimes passes along the Hollow, like a midnight blast, is owing to his being belated, and in a hurry to get back to the churchyard before daybreak.  Such is the general purport of this legendary superstition, which has furnished materials for many a wild story in that region of shadows; and the spectre is known at all the country firesides, by the name of the Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow.  It is remarkable that the visionary propensity I have mentioned is not confined to the native inhabitants of the valley, but is unconsciously imbibed by every one who resides there for a time. However wide awake they may have been before they entered that sleepy region, they are sure, in a little time, to inhale the witching influence of the air, and begin to grow imaginative, to dream dreams, and see apparitions.  I mention this peaceful spot with all possible laud, for it is in such little retired Dutch valleys, found here and there embosomed in the great State of New York, that population, manners, and customs remain fixed, while the great torrent of migration and improvement, which is making such incessant changes in other parts of this restless country, sweeps by them unobserved. They are like those little nooks of still water, which border a rapid stream, where we may see the straw and bubble riding quietly at anchor, or slowly revolving in their mimic harbor, undisturbed by the rush of the passing current. Though many years have elapsed since I trod the drowsy shades of Sleepy Hollow, yet I question whether I should not still find the same trees and the same families vegetating in its sheltered bosom.  In this by-place of nature there abode, in a remote period of American history, that is to say, some thirty years since, a worthy wight of the name of Ichabod Crane, who sojourned, or, as he expressed it, tarried, in Sleepy Hollow, for the purpose of instructing the children of the vicinity. He was a native of Connecticut, a State which supplies the Union with pioneers for the mind as well as for the forest, and sends forth yearly its legions of frontier woodmen and country schoolmasters. The cognomen of Crane was not inapplicable to his person. He was tall, but exceedingly lank, with narrow shoulders, long arms and legs, hands that dangled a mile out of his sleeves, feet that might have served for shovels, and his whole frame most loosely hung together. His head was small, and flat at top, with huge ears, large green glassy eyes, and a long snipe nose, so that it looked like a weather-cock perched upon his spindle neck to tell which way the wind blew. To see him striding along the profile of a hill on a windy day, with his clothes bagging and fluttering about him, one might have mistaken him for the genius of famine descending upon the earth, or some scarecrow eloped from a cornfield.  His schoolhouse was a low building of one large room, rudely constructed of logs; the windows partly glazed, and partly patched with leaves of old copybooks. It was most ingeniously secured at vacant hours, by a withe twisted in the handle of the door, and stakes set against the window shutters; so that though a thief might get in with perfect ease, he would find some embarrassment in getting out,--an idea most probably borrowed by the architect, Yost Van Houten, from the mystery of an eelpot. The schoolhouse stood in a rather lonely but pleasant situation, just at the foot of a woody hill, with a brook running close by, and a formidable birch-tree growing at one end of it. From hence the low murmur of his pupils' voices, conning over their lessons, might be heard in a drowsy summer's day, like the hum of a beehive; interrupted now and then by the authoritative voice of the master, in the tone of menace or command, or, peradventure, by the appalling sound of the birch, as he urged some tardy loiterer along the flowery path of knowledge. Truth to say, he was a conscientious man, and ever bore in mind the golden maxim, Spare the rod and spoil the child. Ichabod Crane's scholars certainly were not spoiled. I would not have it imagined, however, that he was one of those cruel potentates of the school who joy in the smart of their subjects; on the contrary, he administered justice with discrimination rather than severity; taking the burden off the backs of the weak, and laying it on those of the strong. Your mere puny stripling, that winced at the least flourish of the rod, was passed by with indulgence; but the claims of justice were satisfied by inflicting a double portion on some little tough wrong-headed, broad-skirted Dutch urchin, who sulked and swelled and grew dogged and sullen beneath the birch. All this he called doing his duty by their parents; and he never inflicted a chastisement without following it by the assurance, so consolatory to the smarting urchin, that he would remember it and thank him for it the longest day he had to live.  When school hours were over, he was even the companion and playmate of the larger boys; and on holiday afternoons would convoy some of the smaller ones home, who happened to have pretty sisters, or good housewives for mothers, noted for the comforts of the cupboard. Indeed, it behooved him to keep on good terms with his pupils. The revenue arising from his school was small, and would have been scarcely sufficient to furnish him with daily bread, for he was a huge feeder, and, though lank, had the dilating powers of an anaconda; but to help out his maintenance, he was, according to country custom in those parts, boarded and lodged at the houses of the farmers whose children he instructed. With these he lived successively a week at a time, thus going the rounds of the neighborhood, with all his worldly effects tied up in a cotton handkerchief.  That all this might not be too onerous on the purses of his rustic patrons, who are apt to consider the costs of schooling a grievous burden, and schoolmasters as mere drones, he had various ways of rendering himself both useful and agreeable. He assisted the farmers occasionally in the lighter labors of their farms, helped to make hay, mended the fences, took the horses to water, drove the cows from pasture, and cut wood for the winter fire. He laid aside, too, all the dominant dignity and absolute sway with which he lorded it in his little empire, the school, and became wonderfully gentle and ingratiating. He found favor in the eyes of the mothers by petting the children, particularly the youngest; and like the lion bold, which whilom so magnanimously the lamb did hold, he would sit with a child on one knee, and rock a cradle with his foot for whole hours together.  In addition to his other vocations, he was the singing-master of the neighborhood, and picked up many bright shillings by instructing the young folks in psalmody. It was a matter of no little vanity to him on Sundays, to take his station in front of the church gallery, with a band of chosen singers; where, in his own mind, he completely carried away the palm from the parson. Certain it is, his voice resounded far above all the rest of the congregation; and there are peculiar quavers still to be heard in that church, and which may even be heard half a mile off, quite to the opposite side of the millpond, on a still Sunday morning, which are said to be legitimately descended from the nose of Ichabod Crane. Thus, by divers little makeshifts, in that ingenious way which is commonly denominated by hook and by crook, the worthy pedagogue got on tolerably enough, and was thought, by all who understood nothing of the labor of headwork, to have a wonderfully easy life of it.  The schoolmaster is generally a man of some importance in the female circle of a rural neighborhood; being considered a kind of idle, gentlemanlike personage, of vastly superior taste and accomplishments to the rough country swains, and, indeed, inferior in learning only to the parson. His appearance, therefore, is apt to occasion some little stir at the tea-table of a farmhouse, and the addition of a supernumerary dish of cakes or sweetmeats, or, peradventure, the parade of a silver teapot. Our man of letters, therefore, was peculiarly happy in the smiles of all the country damsels. How he would figure among them in the churchyard, between services on Sundays; gathering grapes for them from the wild vines that overran the surrounding trees; reciting for their amusement all the epitaphs on the tombstones; or sauntering, with a whole bevy of them, along the banks of the adjacent millpond; while the more bashful country bumpkins hung sheepishly back, envying his superior elegance and address.  From his half-itinerant life, also, he was a kind of travelling gazette, carrying the whole budget of local gossip from house to house, so that his appearance was always greeted with satisfaction. He was, moreover, esteemed by the women as a man of great erudition, for he had read several books quite through, and was a perfect master of Cotton Mather's History of New England Witchcraft, in which, by the way, he most firmly and potently believed.  He was, in fact, an odd mixture of small shrewdness and simple credulity. His appetite for the marvellous, and his powers of digesting it, were equally extraordinary; and both had been increased by his residence in this spell-bound region. No tale was too gross or monstrous for his capacious swallow. It was often his delight, after his school was dismissed in the afternoon, to stretch himself on the rich bed of clover bordering the little brook that whimpered by his schoolhouse, and there con over old Mather's direful tales, until the gathering dusk of evening made the printed page a mere mist before his eyes. Then, as he wended his way by swamp and stream and awful woodland, to the farmhouse where he happened to be quartered, every sound of nature, at that witching hour, fluttered his excited imagination,--the moan of the whip-poor-will from the hillside, the boding cry of the tree toad, that harbinger of storm, the dreary hooting of the screech owl, or the sudden rustling in the thicket of birds frightened from their roost. The fireflies, too, which sparkled most vividly in the darkest places, now and then startled him, as one of uncommon brightness would stream across his path; and if, by chance, a huge blockhead of a beetle came winging his blundering flight against him, the poor varlet was ready to give up the ghost, with the idea that he was struck with a witch's token. His only resource on such occasions, either to drown thought or drive away evil spirits, was to sing psalm tunes and the good people of Sleepy Hollow, as they sat by their doors of an evening, were often filled with awe at hearing his nasal melody, in linked sweetness long drawn out, floating from the distant hill, or along the dusky road.  Another of his sources of fearful pleasure was to pass long winter evenings with the old Dutch wives, as they sat spinning by the fire, with a row of apples roasting and spluttering along the hearth, and listen to their marvellous tales of ghosts and goblins, and haunted fields, and haunted brooks, and haunted bridges, and haunted houses, and particularly of the headless horseman, or Galloping Hessian of the Hollow, as they sometimes called him. He would delight them equally by his anecdotes of witchcraft, and of the direful omens and portentous sights and sounds in the air, which prevailed in the earlier times of Connecticut; and would frighten them woefully with speculations upon comets and shooting stars; and with the alarming fact that the world did absolutely turn round, and that they were half the time topsy-turvy!  But if there was a pleasure in all this, while snugly cuddling in the chimney corner of a chamber that was all of a ruddy glow from the crackling wood fire, and where, of course, no spectre dared to show its face, it was dearly purchased by the terrors of his subsequent walk homewards. What fearful shapes and shadows beset his path, amidst the dim and ghastly glare of a snowy night! With what wistful look did he eye every trembling ray of light streaming across the waste fields from some distant window! How often was he appalled by some shrub covered with snow, which, like a sheeted spectre, beset his very path! How often did he shrink with curdling awe at the sound of his own steps on the frosty crust beneath his feet; and dread to look over his shoulder, lest he should behold some uncouth being tramping close behind him! And how often was he thrown into complete dismay by some rushing blast, howling among the trees, in the idea that it was the Galloping Hessian on one of his nightly scourings!  All these, however, were mere terrors of the night, phantoms of the mind that walk in darkness; and though he had seen many spectres in his time, and been more than once beset by Satan in divers shapes, in his lonely perambulations, yet daylight put an end to all these evils; and he would have passed a pleasant life of it, in despite of the Devil and all his works, if his path had not been crossed by a being that causes more perplexity to mortal man than ghosts, goblins, and the whole race of witches put together, and that was--a woman.  Among the musical disciples who assembled, one evening in each week, to receive his instructions in psalmody, was Katrina Van Tassel, the daughter and only child of a substantial Dutch farmer. She was a blooming lass of fresh eighteen; plump as a partridge; ripe and melting and rosy-cheeked as one of her father's peaches, and universally famed, not merely for her beauty, but her vast expectations. She was withal a little of a coquette, as might be perceived even in her dress, which was a mixture of ancient and modern fashions, as most suited to set off her charms. She wore the ornaments of pure yellow gold, which her great-great-grandmother had brought over from Saardam; the tempting stomacher of the olden time, and withal a provokingly short petticoat, to display the prettiest foot and ankle in the country round.  Ichabod Crane had a soft and foolish heart towards the sex; and it is not to be wondered at that so tempting a morsel soon found favor in his eyes, more especially after he had visited her in her paternal mansion. Old Baltus Van Tassel was a perfect picture of a thriving, contented, liberal-hearted farmer. He seldom, it is true, sent either his eyes or his thoughts beyond the boundaries of his own farm; but within those everything was snug, happy and well-conditioned. He was satisfied with his wealth, but not proud of it; and piqued himself upon the hearty abundance, rather than the style in which he lived. His stronghold was situated on the banks of the Hudson, in one of those green, sheltered, fertile nooks in which the Dutch farmers are so fond of nestling. A great elm tree spread its broad branches over it, at the foot of which bubbled up a spring of the softest and sweetest water, in a little well formed of a barrel; and then stole sparkling away through the grass, to a neighboring brook, that babbled along among alders and dwarf willows. Hard by the farmhouse was a vast barn, that might have served for a church; every window and crevice of which seemed bursting forth with the treasures of the farm; the flail was busily resounding within it from morning to night; swallows and martins skimmed twittering about the eaves; and rows of pigeons, some with one eye turned up, as if watching the weather, some with their heads under their wings or buried in their bosoms, and others swelling, and cooing, and bowing about their dames, were enjoying the sunshine on the roof. Sleek unwieldy porkers were grunting in the repose and abundance of their pens, from whence sallied forth, now and then, troops of sucking pigs, as if to snuff the air. A stately squadron of snowy geese were riding in an adjoining pond, convoying whole fleets of ducks; regiments of turkeys were gobbling through the farmyard, and Guinea fowls fretting about it, like ill-tempered housewives, with their peevish, discontented cry. Before the barn door strutted the gallant cock, that pattern of a husband, a warrior and a fine gentleman, clapping his burnished wings and crowing in the pride and gladness of his heart,--sometimes tearing up the earth with his feet, and then generously calling his ever-hungry family of wives and children to enjoy the rich morsel which he had discovered.  The pedagogue's mouth watered as he looked upon this sumptuous promise of luxurious winter fare. In his devouring mind's eye, he pictured to himself every roasting-pig running about with a pudding in his belly, and an apple in his mouth; the pigeons were snugly put to bed in a comfortable pie, and tucked in with a coverlet of crust; the geese were swimming in their own gravy; and the ducks pairing cosily in dishes, like snug married couples, with a decent competency of onion sauce. In the porkers he saw carved out the future sleek side of bacon, and juicy relishing ham; not a turkey but he beheld daintily trussed up, with its gizzard under its wing, and, peradventure, a necklace of savory sausages; and even bright chanticleer himself lay sprawling on his back, in a side dish, with uplifted claws, as if craving that quarter which his chivalrous spirit disdained to ask while living. As the enraptured Ichabod fancied all this, and as he rolled his great green eyes over the fat meadow lands, the rich fields of wheat, of rye, of buckwheat, and Indian corn, and the orchards burdened with ruddy fruit, which surrounded the warm tenement of Van Tassel, his heart yearned after the damsel who was to inherit these domains, and his imagination expanded with the idea, how they might be readily turned into cash, and the money invested in immense tracts of wild land, and shingle palaces in the wilderness. Nay, his busy fancy already realized his hopes, and presented to him the blooming Katrina, with a whole family of children, mounted on the top of a wagon loaded with household trumpery, with pots and kettles dangling beneath; and he beheld himself bestriding a pacing mare, with a colt at her heels, setting out for Kentucky, Tennessee,--or the Lord knows where!  When he entered the house, the conquest of his heart was complete. It was one of those spacious farmhouses, with high-ridged but lowly sloping roofs, built in the style handed down from the first Dutch settlers; the low projecting eaves forming a piazza along the front, capable of being closed up in bad weather. Under this were hung flails, harness, various utensils of husbandry, and nets for fishing in the neighboring river. Benches were built along the sides for summer use; and a great spinning-wheel at one end, and a churn at the other, showed the various uses to which this important porch might be devoted. From this piazza the wondering Ichabod entered the hall, which formed the centre of the mansion, and the place of usual residence. Here rows of resplendent pewter, ranged on a long dresser, dazzled his eyes. In one corner stood a huge bag of wool, ready to be spun; in another, a quantity of linsey-woolsey just from the loom; ears of Indian corn, and strings of dried apples and peaches, hung in gay festoons along the walls, mingled with the gaud of red peppers; and a door left ajar gave him a peep into the best parlor, where the claw-footed chairs and dark mahogany tables shone like mirrors; andirons, with their accompanying shovel and tongs, glistened from their covert of asparagus tops; mock-oranges and conch-shells decorated the mantelpiece; strings of various-colored birds eggs were suspended above it; a great ostrich egg was hung from the centre of the room, and a corner cupboard, knowingly left open, displayed immense treasures of old silver and well-mended china.  From the moment Ichabod laid his eyes upon these regions of delight, the peace of his mind was at an end, and his only study was how to gain the affections of the peerless daughter of Van Tassel. In this enterprise, however, he had more real difficulties than generally fell to the lot of a knight-errant of yore, who seldom had anything but giants, enchanters, fiery dragons, and such like easily conquered adversaries, to contend with and had to make his way merely through gates of iron and brass, and walls of adamant to the castle keep, where the lady of his heart was confined; all which he achieved as easily as a man would carve his way to the centre of a Christmas pie; and then the lady gave him her hand as a matter of course. Ichabod, on the contrary, had to win his way to the heart of a country coquette, beset with a labyrinth of whims and caprices, which were forever presenting new difficulties and impediments; and he had to encounter a host of fearful adversaries of real flesh and blood, the numerous rustic admirers, who beset every portal to her heart, keeping a watchful and angry eye upon each other, but ready to fly out in the common cause against any new competitor.  Among these, the most formidable was a burly, roaring, roystering blade, of the name of Abraham, or, according to the Dutch abbreviation, Brom Van Brunt, the hero of the country round, which rang with his feats of strength and hardihood. He was broad-shouldered and double-jointed, with short curly black hair, and a bluff but not unpleasant countenance, having a mingled air of fun and arrogance. From his Herculean frame and great powers of limb he had received the nickname of BROM BONES, by which he was universally known. He was famed for great knowledge and skill in horsemanship, being as dexterous on horseback as a Tartar. He was foremost at all races and cock fights; and, with the ascendancy which bodily strength always acquires in rustic life, was the umpire in all disputes, setting his hat on one side, and giving his decisions with an air and tone that admitted of no gainsay or appeal. He was always ready for either a fight or a frolic; but had more mischief than ill-will in his composition; and with all his overbearing roughness, there was a strong dash of waggish good humor at bottom. He had three or four boon companions, who regarded him as their model, and at the head of whom he scoured the country, attending every scene of feud or merriment for miles round. In cold weather he was distinguished by a fur cap, surmounted with a flaunting fox's tail; and when the folks at a country gathering descried this well-known crest at a distance, whisking about among a squad of hard riders, they always stood by for a squall. Sometimes his crew would be heard dashing along past the farmhouses at midnight, with whoop and halloo, like a troop of Don Cossacks; and the old dames, startled out of their sleep, would listen for a moment till the hurry-scurry had clattered by, and then exclaim, Ay, there goes Brom Bones and his gang! The neighbors looked upon him with a mixture of awe, admiration, and good-will; and, when any madcap prank or rustic brawl occurred in the vicinity, always shook their heads, and warranted Brom Bones was at the bottom of it.  This rantipole hero had for some time singled out the blooming Katrina for the object of his uncouth gallantries, and though his amorous toyings were something like the gentle caresses and endearments of a bear, yet it was whispered that she did not altogether discourage his hopes. Certain it is, his advances were signals for rival candidates to retire, who felt no inclination to cross a lion in his amours; insomuch, that when his horse was seen tied to Van Tassel's paling, on a Sunday night, a sure sign that his master was courting, or, as it is termed, sparking, within, all other suitors passed by in despair, and carried the war into other quarters.  Such was the formidable rival with whom Ichabod Crane had to contend, and, considering all things, a stouter man than he would have shrunk from the competition, and a wiser man would have despaired. He had, however, a happy mixture of pliability and perseverance in his nature; he was in form and spirit like a supple-jack--yielding, but tough; though he bent, he never broke; and though he bowed beneath the slightest pressure, yet, the moment it was away--jerk!--he was as erect, and carried his head as high as ever.  To have taken the field openly against his rival would have been madness; for he was not a man to be thwarted in his amours, any more than that stormy lover, Achilles. Ichabod, therefore, made his advances in a quiet and gently insinuating manner. Under cover of his character of singing-master, he made frequent visits at the farmhouse; not that he had anything to apprehend from the meddlesome interference of parents, which is so often a stumbling-block in the path of lovers. Balt Van Tassel was an easy indulgent soul; he loved his daughter better even than his pipe, and, like a reasonable man and an excellent father, let her have her way in everything. His notable little wife, too, had enough to do to attend to her housekeeping and manage her poultry; for, as she sagely observed, ducks and geese are foolish things, and must be looked after, but girls can take care of themselves. Thus, while the busy dame bustled about the house, or plied her spinning-wheel at one end of the piazza, honest Balt would sit smoking his evening pipe at the other, watching the achievements of a little wooden warrior, who, armed with a sword in each hand, was most valiantly fighting the wind on the pinnacle of the barn. In the mean time, Ichabod would carry on his suit with the daughter by the side of the spring under the great elm, or sauntering along in the twilight, that hour so favorable to the lover's eloquence.  I profess not to know how women's hearts are wooed and won. To me they have always been matters of riddle and admiration. Some seem to have but one vulnerable point, or door of access; while others have a thousand avenues, and may be captured in a thousand different ways. It is a great triumph of skill to gain the former, but a still greater proof of generalship to maintain possession of the latter, for man must battle for his fortress at every door and window. He who wins a thousand common hearts is therefore entitled to some renown; but he who keeps undisputed sway over the heart of a coquette is indeed a hero. Certain it is, this was not the case with the redoubtable Brom Bones; and from the moment Ichabod Crane made his advances, the interests of the former evidently declined: his horse was no longer seen tied to the palings on Sunday nights, and a deadly feud gradually arose between him and the preceptor of Sleepy Hollow.  Brom, who had a degree of rough chivalry in his nature, would fain have carried matters to open warfare and have settled their pretensions to the lady, according to the mode of those most concise and simple reasoners, the knights-errant of yore,--by single combat; but Ichabod was too conscious of the superior might of his adversary to enter the lists against him; he had overheard a boast of Bones, that he would double the schoolmaster up, and lay him on a shelf of his own schoolhouse; and he was too wary to give him an opportunity. There was something extremely provoking in this obstinately pacific system; it left Brom no alternative but to draw upon the funds of rustic waggery in his disposition, and to play off boorish practical jokes upon his rival. Ichabod became the object of whimsical persecution to Bones and his gang of rough riders. They harried his hitherto peaceful domains; smoked out his singing school by stopping up the chimney; broke into the schoolhouse at night, in spite of its formidable fastenings of withe and window stakes, and turned everything topsy-turvy, so that the poor schoolmaster began to think all the witches in the country held their meetings there. But what was still more annoying, Brom took all opportunities of turning him into ridicule in presence of his mistress, and had a scoundrel dog whom he taught to whine in the most ludicrous manner, and introduced as a rival of Ichabod's, to instruct her in psalmody.  In this way matters went on for some time, without producing any material effect on the relative situations of the contending powers. On a fine autumnal afternoon, Ichabod, in pensive mood, sat enthroned on the lofty stool from whence he usually watched all the concerns of his little literary realm. In his hand he swayed a ferule, that sceptre of despotic power; the birch of justice reposed on three nails behind the throne, a constant terror to evil doers, while on the desk before him might be seen sundry contraband articles and prohibited weapons, detected upon the persons of idle urchins, such as half-munched apples, popguns, whirligigs, fly-cages, and whole legions of rampant little paper gamecocks. Apparently there had been some appalling act of justice recently inflicted, for his scholars were all busily intent upon their books, or slyly whispering behind them with one eye kept upon the master; and a kind of buzzing stillness reigned throughout the schoolroom. It was suddenly interrupted by the appearance of a negro in tow-cloth jacket and trowsers, a round-crowned fragment of a hat, like the cap of Mercury, and mounted on the back of a ragged, wild, half-broken colt, which he managed with a rope by way of halter. He came clattering up to the school door with an invitation to Ichabod to attend a merry-making or quilting frolic, to be held that evening at Mynheer Van Tassel's; and having delivered his message with that air of importance, and effort at fine language, which a negro is apt to display on petty embassies of the kind, he dashed over the brook, and was seen scampering away up the hollow, full of the importance and hurry of his mission.  All was now bustle and hubbub in the late quiet schoolroom. The scholars were hurried through their lessons without stopping at trifles; those who were nimble skipped over half with impunity, and those who were tardy had a smart application now and then in the rear, to quicken their speed or help them over a tall word. Books were flung aside without being put away on the shelves, inkstands were overturned, benches thrown down, and the whole school was turned loose an hour before the usual time, bursting forth like a legion of young imps, yelping and racketing about the green in joy at their early emancipation.  The gallant Ichabod now spent at least an extra half hour at his toilet, brushing and furbishing up his best, and indeed only suit of rusty black, and arranging his locks by a bit of broken looking-glass that hung up in the schoolhouse. That he might make his appearance before his mistress in the true style of a cavalier, he borrowed a horse from the farmer with whom he was domiciliated, a choleric old Dutchman of the name of Hans Van Ripper, and, thus gallantly mounted, issued forth like a knight-errant in quest of adventures. But it is meet I should, in the true spirit of romantic story, give some account of the looks and equipments of my hero and his steed. The animal he bestrode was a broken-down plow-horse, that had outlived almost everything but its viciousness. He was gaunt and shagged, with a ewe neck, and a head like a hammer; his rusty mane and tail were tangled and knotted with burs; one eye had lost its pupil, and was glaring and spectral, but the other had the gleam of a genuine devil in it. Still he must have had fire and mettle in his day, if we may judge from the name he bore of Gunpowder. He had, in fact, been a favorite steed of his master's, the choleric Van Ripper, who was a furious rider, and had infused, very probably, some of his own spirit into the animal; for, old and broken-down as he looked, there was more of the lurking devil in him than in any young filly in the country.  Ichabod was a suitable figure for such a steed. He rode with short stirrups, which brought his knees nearly up to the pommel of the saddle; his sharp elbows stuck out like grasshoppers'; he carried his whip perpendicularly in his hand, like a sceptre, and as his horse jogged on, the motion of his arms was not unlike the flapping of a pair of wings. A small wool hat rested on the top of his nose, for so his scanty strip of forehead might be called, and the skirts of his black coat fluttered out almost to the horses tail. Such was the appearance of Ichabod and his steed as they shambled out of the gate of Hans Van Ripper, and it was altogether such an apparition as is seldom to be met with in broad daylight. It was, as I have said, a fine autumnal day; the sky was clear and serene, and nature wore that rich and golden livery which we always associate with the idea of abundance. The forests had put on their sober brown and yellow, while some trees of the tenderer kind had been nipped by the frosts into brilliant dyes of orange, purple, and scarlet. Streaming files of wild ducks began to make their appearance high in the air; the bark of the squirrel might be heard from the groves of beech and hickory-nuts, and the pensive whistle of the quail at intervals from the neighboring stubble field.  The small birds were taking their farewell banquets. In the fullness of their revelry, they fluttered, chirping and frolicking from bush to bush, and tree to tree, capricious from the very profusion and variety around them. There was the honest cock robin, the favorite game of stripling sportsmen, with its loud querulous note; and the twittering blackbirds flying in sable clouds; and the golden-winged woodpecker with his crimson crest, his broad black gorget, and splendid plumage; and the cedar bird, with its red-tipt wings and yellow-tipt tail and its little monteiro cap of feathers; and the blue jay, that noisy coxcomb, in his gay light blue coat and white underclothes, screaming and chattering, nodding and bobbing and bowing, and pretending to be on good terms with every songster of the grove.  As Ichabod jogged slowly on his way, his eye, ever open to every symptom of culinary abundance, ranged with delight over the treasures of jolly autumn. On all sides he beheld vast store of apples; some hanging in oppressive opulence on the trees; some gathered into baskets and barrels for the market; others heaped up in rich piles for the cider-press. Farther on he beheld great fields of Indian corn, with its golden ears peeping from their leafy coverts, and holding out the promise of cakes and hasty-pudding; and the yellow pumpkins lying beneath them, turning up their fair round bellies to the sun, and giving ample prospects of the most luxurious of pies; and anon he passed the fragrant buckwheat fields breathing the odor of the beehive, and as he beheld them, soft anticipations stole over his mind of dainty slapjacks, well buttered, and garnished with honey or treacle, by the delicate little dimpled hand of Katrina Van Tassel.  Thus feeding his mind with many sweet thoughts and sugared suppositions, he journeyed along the sides of a range of hills which look out upon some of the goodliest scenes of the mighty Hudson. The sun gradually wheeled his broad disk down in the west. The wide bosom of the Tappan Zee lay motionless and glassy, excepting that here and there a gentle undulation waved and prolonged the blue shadow of the distant mountain. A few amber clouds floated in the sky, without a breath of air to move them. The horizon was of a fine golden tint, changing gradually into a pure apple green, and from that into the deep blue of the mid-heaven. A slanting ray lingered on the woody crests of the precipices that overhung some parts of the river, giving greater depth to the dark gray and purple of their rocky sides. A sloop was loitering in the distance, dropping slowly down with the tide, her sail hanging uselessly against the mast; and as the reflection of the sky gleamed along the still water, it seemed as if the vessel was suspended in the air.  It was toward evening that Ichabod arrived at the castle of the Heer Van Tassel, which he found thronged with the pride and flower of the adjacent country. Old farmers, a spare leathern-faced race, in homespun coats and breeches, blue stockings, huge shoes, and magnificent pewter buckles. Their brisk, withered little dames, in close-crimped caps, long-waisted short gowns, homespun petticoats, with scissors and pincushions, and gay calico pockets hanging on the outside. Buxom lasses, almost as antiquated as their mothers, excepting where a straw hat, a fine ribbon, or perhaps a white frock, gave symptoms of city innovation. The sons, in short square-skirted coats, with rows of stupendous brass buttons, and their hair generally queued in the fashion of the times, especially if they could procure an eel-skin for the purpose, it being esteemed throughout the country as a potent nourisher and strengthener of the hair.  Brom Bones, however, was the hero of the scene, having come to the gathering on his favorite steed Daredevil, a creature, like himself, full of mettle and mischief, and which no one but himself could manage. He was, in fact, noted for preferring vicious animals, given to all kinds of tricks which kept the rider in constant risk of his neck, for he held a tractable, well-broken horse as unworthy of a lad of spirit.  Fain would I pause to dwell upon the world of charms that burst upon the enraptured gaze of my hero, as he entered the state parlor of Van Tassel's mansion. Not those of the bevy of buxom lasses, with their luxurious display of red and white; but the ample charms of a genuine Dutch country tea-table, in the sumptuous time of autumn. Such heaped up platters of cakes of various and almost indescribable kinds, known only to experienced Dutch housewives! There was the doughty doughnut, the tender oly koek, and the crisp and crumbling cruller; sweet cakes and short cakes, ginger cakes and honey cakes, and the whole family of cakes. And then there were apple pies, and peach pies, and pumpkin pies; besides slices of ham and smoked beef; and moreover delectable dishes of preserved plums, and peaches, and pears, and quinces; not to mention broiled shad and roasted chickens; together with bowls of milk and cream, all mingled higgledy-piggledy, pretty much as I have enumerated them, with the motherly teapot sending up its clouds of vapor from the midst--Heaven bless the mark! I want breath and time to discuss this banquet as it deserves, and am too eager to get on with my story. Happily, Ichabod Crane was not in so great a hurry as his historian, but did ample justice to every dainty.  He was a kind and thankful creature, whose heart dilated in proportion as his skin was filled with good cheer, and whose spirits rose with eating, as some men's do with drink. He could not help, too, rolling his large eyes round him as he ate, and chuckling with the possibility that he might one day be lord of all this scene of almost unimaginable luxury and splendor. Then, he thought, how soon he'd turn his back upon the old schoolhouse; snap his fingers in the face of Hans Van Ripper, and every other niggardly patron, and kick any itinerant pedagogue out of doors that should dare to call him comrade!  Old Baltus Van Tassel moved about among his guests with a face dilated with content and good humor, round and jolly as the harvest moon. His hospitable attentions were brief, but expressive, being confined to a shake of the hand, a slap on the shoulder, a loud laugh, and a pressing invitation to fall to, and help themselves.  And now the sound of the music from the common room, or hall, summoned to the dance. The musician was an old gray-headed negro, who had been the itinerant orchestra of the neighborhood for more than half a century. His instrument was as old and battered as himself. The greater part of the time he scraped on two or three strings, accompanying every movement of the bow with a motion of the head; bowing almost to the ground, and stamping with his foot whenever a fresh couple were to start.  Ichabod prided himself upon his dancing as much as upon his vocal powers. Not a limb, not a fibre about him was idle; and to have seen his loosely hung frame in full motion, and clattering about the room, you would have thought St. Vitus himself, that blessed patron of the dance, was figuring before you in person. He was the admiration of all the negroes; who, having gathered, of all ages and sizes, from the farm and the neighborhood, stood forming a pyramid of shining black faces at every door and window, gazing with delight at the scene, rolling their white eyeballs, and showing grinning rows of ivory from ear to ear. How could the flogger of urchins be otherwise than animated and joyous? The lady of his heart was his partner in the dance, and smiling graciously in reply to all his amorous oglings; while Brom Bones, sorely smitten with love and jealousy, sat brooding by himself in one corner.  When the dance was at an end, Ichabod was attracted to a knot of the sager folks, who, with Old Van Tassel, sat smoking at one end of the piazza, gossiping over former times, and drawing out long stories about the war.  This neighborhood, at the time of which I am speaking, was one of those highly favored places which abound with chronicle and great men. The British and American line had run near it during the war; it had, therefore, been the scene of marauding and infested with refugees, cowboys, and all kinds of border chivalry. Just sufficient time had elapsed to enable each storyteller to dress up his tale with a little becoming fiction, and, in the indistinctness of his recollection, to make himself the hero of every exploit.  There was the story of Doffue Martling, a large blue-bearded Dutchman, who had nearly taken a British frigate with an old iron nine-pounder from a mud breastwork, only that his gun burst at the sixth discharge. And there was an old gentleman who shall be nameless, being too rich a mynheer to be lightly mentioned, who, in the battle of White Plains, being an excellent master of defence, parried a musket-ball with a small sword, insomuch that he absolutely felt it whiz round the blade, and glance off at the hilt; in proof of which he was ready at any time to show the sword, with the hilt a little bent. There were several more that had been equally great in the field, not one of whom but was persuaded that he had a considerable hand in bringing the war to a happy termination.  But all these were nothing to the tales of ghosts and apparitions that succeeded. The neighborhood is rich in legendary treasures of the kind. Local tales and superstitions thrive best in these sheltered, long-settled retreats; but are trampled under foot by the shifting throng that forms the population of most of our country places. Besides, there is no encouragement for ghosts in most of our villages, for they have scarcely had time to finish their first nap and turn themselves in their graves, before their surviving friends have travelled away from the neighborhood; so that when they turn out at night to walk their rounds, they have no acquaintance left to call upon. This is perhaps the reason why we so seldom hear of ghosts except in our long-established Dutch communities.  The immediate cause, however, of the prevalence of supernatural stories in these parts, was doubtless owing to the vicinity of Sleepy Hollow. There was a contagion in the very air that blew from that haunted region; it breathed forth an atmosphere of dreams and fancies infecting all the land. Several of the Sleepy Hollow people were present at Van Tassel's, and, as usual, were doling out their wild and wonderful legends. Many dismal tales were told about funeral trains, and mourning cries and wailings heard and seen about the great tree where the unfortunate Major Andre was taken, and which stood in the neighborhood. Some mention was made also of the woman in white, that haunted the dark glen at Raven Rock, and was often heard to shriek on winter nights before a storm, having perished there in the snow. The chief part of the stories, however, turned upon the favorite spectre of Sleepy Hollow, the Headless Horseman, who had been heard several times of late, patrolling the country; and, it was said, tethered his horse nightly among the graves in the churchyard.  The sequestered situation of this church seems always to have made it a favorite haunt of troubled spirits. It stands on a knoll, surrounded by locust-trees and lofty elms, from among which its decent, whitewashed walls shine modestly forth, like Christian purity beaming through the shades of retirement. A gentle slope descends from it to a silver sheet of water, bordered by high trees, between which, peeps may be caught at the blue hills of the Hudson. To look upon its grass-grown yard, where the sunbeams seem to sleep so quietly, one would think that there at least the dead might rest in peace. On one side of the church extends a wide woody dell, along which raves a large brook among broken rocks and trunks of fallen trees. Over a deep black part of the stream, not far from the church, was formerly thrown a wooden bridge; the road that led to it, and the bridge itself, were thickly shaded by overhanging trees, which cast a gloom about it, even in the daytime; but occasioned a fearful darkness at night. Such was one of the favorite haunts of the Headless Horseman, and the place where he was most frequently encountered. The tale was told of old Brouwer, a most heretical disbeliever in ghosts, how he met the Horseman returning from his foray into Sleepy Hollow, and was obliged to get up behind him; how they galloped over bush and brake, over hill and swamp, until they reached the bridge; when the Horseman suddenly turned into a skeleton, threw old Brouwer into the brook, and sprang away over the tree-tops with a clap of thunder.  This story was immediately matched by a thrice marvellous adventure of Brom Bones, who made light of the Galloping Hessian as an arrant jockey. He affirmed that on returning one night from the neighboring village of Sing Sing, he had been overtaken by this midnight trooper; that he had offered to race with him for a bowl of punch, and should have won it too, for Daredevil beat the goblin horse all hollow, but just as they came to the church bridge, the Hessian bolted, and vanished in a flash of fire.  All these tales, told in that drowsy undertone with which men talk in the dark, the countenances of the listeners only now and then receiving a casual gleam from the glare of a pipe, sank deep in the mind of Ichabod. He repaid them in kind with large extracts from his invaluable author, Cotton Mather, and added many marvellous events that had taken place in his native State of Connecticut, and fearful sights which he had seen in his nightly walks about Sleepy Hollow.  The revel now gradually broke up. The old farmers gathered together their families in their wagons, and were heard for some time rattling along the hollow roads, and over the distant hills. Some of the damsels mounted on pillions behind their favorite swains, and their light-hearted laughter, mingling with the clatter of hoofs, echoed along the silent woodlands, sounding fainter and fainter, until they gradually died away,--and the late scene of noise and frolic was all silent and deserted. Ichabod only lingered behind, according to the custom of country lovers, to have a tete-a-tete with the heiress; fully convinced that he was now on the high road to success. What passed at this interview I will not pretend to say, for in fact I do not know. Something, however, I fear me, must have gone wrong, for he certainly sallied forth, after no very great interval, with an air quite desolate and chapfallen. Oh, these women! these women! Could that girl have been playing off any of her coquettish tricks? Was her encouragement of the poor pedagogue all a mere sham to secure her conquest of his rival? Heaven only knows, not I! Let it suffice to say, Ichabod stole forth with the air of one who had been sacking a henroost, rather than a fair lady's heart. Without looking to the right or left to notice the scene of rural wealth, on which he had so often gloated, he went straight to the stable, and with several hearty cuffs and kicks roused his steed most uncourteously from the comfortable quarters in which he was soundly sleeping, dreaming of mountains of corn and oats, and whole valleys of timothy and clover.  It was the very witching time of night that Ichabod, heavy-hearted and crestfallen, pursued his travels homewards, along the sides of the lofty hills which rise above Tarry Town, and which he had traversed so cheerily in the afternoon. The hour was as dismal as himself. Far below him the Tappan Zee spread its dusky and indistinct waste of waters, with here and there the tall mast of a sloop, riding quietly at anchor under the land. In the dead hush of midnight, he could even hear the barking of the watchdog from the opposite shore of the Hudson; but it was so vague and faint as only to give an idea of his distance from this faithful companion of man. Now and then, too, the long-drawn crowing of a cock, accidentally awakened, would sound far, far off, from some farmhouse away among the hills--but it was like a dreaming sound in his ear. No signs of life occurred near him, but occasionally the melancholy chirp of a cricket, or perhaps the guttural twang of a bullfrog from a neighboring marsh, as if sleeping uncomfortably and turning suddenly in his bed.  All the stories of ghosts and goblins that he had heard in the afternoon now came crowding upon his recollection. The night grew darker and darker; the stars seemed to sink deeper in the sky, and driving clouds occasionally hid them from his sight. He had never felt so lonely and dismal. He was, moreover, approaching the very place where many of the scenes of the ghost stories had been laid. In the centre of the road stood an enormous tulip-tree, which towered like a giant above all the other trees of the neighborhood, and formed a kind of landmark. Its limbs were gnarled and fantastic, large enough to form trunks for ordinary trees, twisting down almost to the earth, and rising again into the air. It was connected with the tragical story of the unfortunate Andre, who had been taken prisoner hard by; and was universally known by the name of Major Andre's tree. The common people regarded it with a mixture of respect and superstition, partly out of sympathy for the fate of its ill-starred namesake, and partly from the tales of strange sights, and doleful lamentations, told concerning it.  As Ichabod approached this fearful tree, he began to whistle; he thought his whistle was answered; it was but a blast sweeping sharply through the dry branches. As he approached a little nearer, he thought he saw something white, hanging in the midst of the tree: he paused and ceased whistling but, on looking more narrowly, perceived that it was a place where the tree had been scathed by lightning, and the white wood laid bare. Suddenly he heard a groan--his teeth chattered, and his knees smote against the saddle: it was but the rubbing of one huge bough upon another, as they were swayed about by the breeze. He passed the tree in safety, but new perils lay before him.  About two hundred yards from the tree, a small brook crossed the road, and ran into a marshy and thickly-wooded glen, known by the name of Wiley's Swamp. A few rough logs, laid side by side, served for a bridge over this stream. On that side of the road where the brook entered the wood, a group of oaks and chestnuts, matted thick with wild grape-vines, threw a cavernous gloom over it. To pass this bridge was the severest trial. It was at this identical spot that the unfortunate Andre was captured, and under the covert of those chestnuts and vines were the sturdy yeomen concealed who surprised him. This has ever since been considered a haunted stream, and fearful are the feelings of the schoolboy who has to pass it alone after dark.  As he approached the stream, his heart began to thump; he summoned up, however, all his resolution, gave his horse half a score of kicks in the ribs, and attempted to dash briskly across the bridge; but instead of starting forward, the perverse old animal made a lateral movement, and ran broadside against the fence. Ichabod, whose fears increased with the delay, jerked the reins on the other side, and kicked lustily with the contrary foot: it was all in vain; his steed started, it is true, but it was only to plunge to the opposite side of the road into a thicket of brambles and alder bushes. The schoolmaster now bestowed both whip and heel upon the starveling ribs of old Gunpowder, who dashed forward, snuffling and snorting, but came to a stand just by the bridge, with a suddenness that had nearly sent his rider sprawling over his head. Just at this moment a plashy tramp by the side of the bridge caught the sensitive ear of Ichabod. In the dark shadow of the grove, on the margin of the brook, he beheld something huge, misshapen and towering. It stirred not, but seemed gathered up in the gloom, like some gigantic monster ready to spring upon the traveller.  The hair of the affrighted pedagogue rose upon his head with terror. What was to be done? To turn and fly was now too late; and besides, what chance was there of escaping ghost or goblin, if such it was, which could ride upon the wings of the wind? Summoning up, therefore, a show of courage, he demanded in stammering accents, Who are you? He received no reply. He repeated his demand in a still more agitated voice. Still there was no answer. Once more he cudgelled the sides of the inflexible Gunpowder, and, shutting his eyes, broke forth with involuntary fervor into a psalm tune. Just then the shadowy object of alarm put itself in motion, and with a scramble and a bound stood at once in the middle of the road. Though the night was dark and dismal, yet the form of the unknown might now in some degree be ascertained. He appeared to be a horseman of large dimensions, and mounted on a black horse of powerful frame. He made no offer of molestation or sociability, but kept aloof on one side of the road, jogging along on the blind side of old Gunpowder, who had now got over his fright and waywardness.  Ichabod, who had no relish for this strange midnight companion, and bethought himself of the adventure of Brom Bones with the Galloping Hessian, now quickened his steed in hopes of leaving him behind. The stranger, however, quickened his horse to an equal pace. Ichabod pulled up, and fell into a walk, thinking to lag behind,--the other did the same. His heart began to sink within him; he endeavored to resume his psalm tune, but his parched tongue clove to the roof of his mouth, and he could not utter a stave. There was something in the moody and dogged silence of this pertinacious companion that was mysterious and appalling. It was soon fearfully accounted for. On mounting a rising ground, which brought the figure of his fellow-traveller in relief against the sky, gigantic in height, and muffled in a cloak, Ichabod was horror-struck on perceiving that he was headless!--but his horror was still more increased on observing that the head, which should have rested on his shoulders, was carried before him on the pommel of his saddle! His terror rose to desperation; he rained a shower of kicks and blows upon Gunpowder, hoping by a sudden movement to give his companion the slip; but the spectre started full jump with him. Away, then, they dashed through thick and thin; stones flying and sparks flashing at every bound. Ichabod's flimsy garments fluttered in the air, as he stretched his long lank body away over his horse's head, in the eagerness of his flight.  They had now reached the road which turns off to Sleepy Hollow; but Gunpowder, who seemed possessed with a demon, instead of keeping up it, made an opposite turn, and plunged headlong downhill to the left. This road leads through a sandy hollow shaded by trees for about a quarter of a mile, where it crosses the bridge famous in goblin story; and just beyond swells the green knoll on which stands the whitewashed church.  As yet the panic of the steed had given his unskilful rider an apparent advantage in the chase, but just as he had got half way through the hollow, the girths of the saddle gave way, and he felt it slipping from under him. He seized it by the pommel, and endeavored to hold it firm, but in vain; and had just time to save himself by clasping old Gunpowder round the neck, when the saddle fell to the earth, and he heard it trampled under foot by his pursuer. For a moment the terror of Hans Van Ripper's wrath passed across his mind,--for it was his Sunday saddle; but this was no time for petty fears; the goblin was hard on his haunches; and  he had much ado to maintain his seat; sometimes slipping on one side, sometimes on another, and sometimes jolted on the high ridge of his horse's backbone, with a violence that he verily feared would cleave him asunder.  An opening in the trees now cheered him with the hopes that the church bridge was at hand. The wavering reflection of a silver star in the bosom of the brook told him that he was not mistaken. He saw the walls of the church dimly glaring under the trees beyond. He recollected the place where Brom Bones's ghostly competitor had disappeared. If I can but reach that bridge, thought Ichabod, I am safe. Just then he heard the black steed panting and blowing close behind him; he even fancied that he felt his hot breath. Another convulsive kick in the ribs, and old Gunpowder sprang upon the bridge; he thundered over the resounding planks; he gained the opposite side; and now Ichabod cast a look behind to see if his pursuer should vanish, according to rule, in a flash of fire and brimstone. Just then he saw the goblin rising in his stirrups, and in the very act of hurling his head at him. Ichabod endeavored to dodge the horrible missile, but too late. It encountered his cranium with a tremendous crash,--he was tumbled headlong into the dust, and Gunpowder, the black steed, and the goblin rider, passed by like a whirlwind.  The next morning the old horse was found without his saddle, and with the bridle under his feet, soberly cropping the grass at his master's gate. Ichabod did not make his appearance at breakfast; dinner-hour came, but no Ichabod. The boys assembled at the schoolhouse, and strolled idly about the banks of the brook; but no schoolmaster. Hans Van Ripper now began to feel some uneasiness about the fate of poor Ichabod, and his saddle. An inquiry was set on foot, and after diligent investigation they came upon his traces. In one part of the road leading to the church was found the saddle trampled in the dirt; the tracks of horses' hoofs deeply dented in the road, and evidently at furious speed, were traced to the bridge, beyond which, on the bank of a broad part of the brook, where the water ran deep and black, was found the hat of the unfortunate Ichabod, and close beside it a shattered pumpkin.  The brook was searched, but the body of the schoolmaster was not to be discovered. Hans Van Ripper as executor of his estate, examined the bundle which contained all his worldly effects. They consisted of two shirts and a half; two stocks for the neck; a pair or two of worsted stockings; an old pair of corduroy small-clothes; a rusty razor; a book of psalm tunes full of dog's-ears; and a broken pitch-pipe. As to the books and furniture of the schoolhouse, they belonged to the community, excepting Cotton Mather's History of Witchcraft, a New England Almanac, and a book of dreams and fortune-telling; in which last was a sheet of foolscap much scribbled and blotted in several fruitless attempts to make a copy of verses in honor of the heiress of Van Tassel. These magic books and the poetic scrawl were forthwith consigned to the flames by Hans Van Ripper; who, from that time forward, determined to send his children no more to school, observing that he never knew any good come of this same reading and writing. Whatever money the schoolmaster possessed, and he had received his quarter's pay but a day or two before, he must have had about his person at the time of his disappearance.  The mysterious event caused much speculation at the church on the following Sunday. Knots of gazers and gossips were collected in the churchyard, at the bridge, and at the spot where the hat and pumpkin had been found. The stories of Brouwer, of Bones, and a whole budget of others were called to mind; and when they had diligently considered them all, and compared them with the symptoms of the present case, they shook their heads, and came to the conclusion that Ichabod had been carried off by the Galloping Hessian. As he was a bachelor, and in nobody's debt, nobody troubled his head any more about him; the school was removed to a different quarter of the hollow, and another pedagogue reigned in his stead.  It is true, an old farmer, who had been down to New York on a visit several years after, and from whom this account of the ghostly adventure was received, brought home the intelligence that Ichabod Crane was still alive; that he had left the neighborhood partly through fear of the goblin and Hans Van Ripper, and partly in mortification at having been suddenly dismissed by the heiress; that he had changed his quarters to a distant part of the country; had kept school and studied law at the same time; had been admitted to the bar; turned politician; electioneered; written for the newspapers; and finally had been made a justice of the Ten Pound Court. Brom Bones, too, who, shortly after his rival's disappearance conducted the blooming Katrina in triumph to the altar, was observed to look exceedingly knowing whenever the story of Ichabod was related, and always burst into a hearty laugh at the mention of the pumpkin; which led some to suspect that he knew more about the matter than he chose to tell. The old country wives, however, who are the best judges of these matters, maintain to this day that Ichabod was spirited away by supernatural means; and it is a favorite story often told about the neighborhood round the winter evening fire. The bridge became more than ever an object of superstitious awe; and that may be the reason why the road has been altered of late years, so as to approach the church by the border of the millpond. The schoolhouse being deserted soon fell to decay, and was reported to be haunted by the ghost of the unfortunate pedagogue and the plowboy, loitering homeward of a still summer evening, has often fancied his voice at a distance, chanting a melancholy psalm tune among the tranquil solitudes of Sleepy Hollow.   Found in the handwriting of Mr. Knickerbocker.  The preceding tale is given almost in the precise words in which I heard it related at a Corporation meeting at the ancient city of Manhattoes, at which were present many of its sagest and most illustrious burghers. The narrator was a pleasant, shabby, gentlemanly old fellow, in pepper-and-salt clothes, with a sadly humourous face, and one whom I strongly suspected of being poor--he made such efforts to be entertaining. When his story was concluded, there was much laughter and approbation, particularly from two or three deputy aldermen, who had been asleep the greater part of the time. There was, however, one tall, dry-looking old gentleman, with beetling eyebrows, who maintained a grave and rather severe face throughout, now and then folding his arms, inclining his head, and looking down upon the floor, as if turning a doubt over in his mind. He was one of your wary men, who never laugh but upon good grounds--when they have reason and law on their side. When the mirth of the rest of the company had subsided, and silence was restored, he leaned one arm on the elbow of his chair, and sticking the other akimbo, demanded, with a slight, but exceedingly sage motion of the head, and contraction of the brow, what was the moral of the story, and what it went to prove?  The story-teller, who was just putting a glass of wine to his lips, as a refreshment after his toils, paused for a moment, looked at his inquirer with an air of infinite deference, and, lowering the glass slowly to the table, observed that the story was intended most logically to prove--  That there is no situation in life but has its advantages and pleasures--provided we will but take a joke as we find it:  That, therefore, he that runs races with goblin troopers is likely to have rough riding of it.  Ergo, for a country schoolmaster to be refused the hand of a Dutch heiress is a certain step to high preferment in the state.  The cautious old gentleman knit his brows tenfold closer after this explanation, being sorely puzzled by the ratiocination of the syllogism, while, methought, the one in pepper-and-salt eyed him with something of a triumphant leer. At length he observed that all this was very well, but still he thought the story a little on the extravagant--there were one or two points on which he had his doubts.  Faith, sir, replied the story-teller, as to that matter, I don't believe one-half of it myself. D. K.7",

It's only one and one, it's true Still I see you in midnight blue   I see  beautiful days And I feel  beautiful ways Of loving you, everything's midnight blue  I will  love you tonight And I will  stay by your side Lovin' you, I'm feelin' midnight blue  I will  love you tonight And I will  stay by your side Lovin' you, I'm feelin' midnight blue2",
        "We're Not Deep  You can put it down to lack of patience Put it down to lack of sleep But it's in my head to stay in bed Tucked under the sheets   They said if I tried to get on, I'd get on They said there were chances, but now my chance has gone   And I know what you think What you think about me Thoughts like that sink home; To you, we're not deep  Ba ba ba-ba ba-ba Ba ba ba-ba ba-ba Ba ba ba-ba ba-ba Ba ba ba-ba ba-ba   Now it may be a sad reflection On the way young people feel But early Monday morning Is losing its appeal  I open my curtains at 7am Just so you think I'm up with the rest of the men   And I know what you think What you think about me Thoughts like that sink home; To you, we're not deep  Ba ba ba-ba ba-ba Ba ba ba-ba ba-ba Ba ba ba-ba ba-ba Ba ba ba-ba ba-ba   You'd do yourself a favour if you gave yourself a break But that's one risk you'd never take The evening's yours, the morning's mine But don't knock me, I'm doing fine  You'd do yourself a favour if you gave yourself a rest But just for now, you know what's best Ah, ah!   And I know what you think What you think about me Thoughts like that sink home; To you, we're not deep Ba ba ba-ba ba-ba Ba ba ba-ba ba-ba Ba ba ba-ba ba-ba Ba ba ba-ba ba-ba",

Let them know that you're okay Just to make them stop All the wondering, questions they may have  I'm okay, I really am now Just needed some time, to figure things out Not telling lies, I'll be honest with you Still we don't know what's yet to come  Have you ever seen your face In a mirror? There's a smile But inside you're just a mess You feel far from good Need to hide, 'cause they'd never understand Have you ever had this wish of being somewhere else?

        "Genius Korea Community's Favorite Albums Of 2021 So Far Hot Sauce - NCT DREAMOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation 'Hot Sauce' is a cohesive yet diverse album. The title track encapsulates this very well with the Spanish vocal sample  as well as the rapid pace and the chanting on the second refrain. It kind of  reminded me of Hitchhiker-produced tracks like 127's MAD DOG. It's followed by Diggity, which combines hard, punchy, and experimental elements with DREAM's cute aesthetic - making it a fan favorite among many.  Dive Into You is one of my two personal preferred songs out of all the B-sides. The strong bassline brings power to the rap verses and drops off for harmonic, melody-driven pre-chorus, only to come back bigger immediately after. The soft slowdown at the end perfectly leads into My Youth. Rocket gives me the vibe that I'm literally blasting off to space and, at some points, feels like I'm riding a Ferris wheel or doing something of the sort at an amusement park. My second preferred song out of the tracklist is Countdown . The best part is the final verse that comes back unexpectedly after the chorus to bring back the track's punchy energy. It definitely did a good job of giving the impression that something big was about to happen. ANL makes me feel like it's just rained and the sun is coming back out from the clouds . Irreplaceable, tells the story of an energizing love with a forever lover - and you don't even need to understand a word to know that. And, finally, Be There For You and Rainbow are heartfelt ballads that sound like they could fit right into an OST.  Overall, there wasn't a miss on NCT DREAM's latest fully-new release and I'll happily listen to the whole thing over again many times. It was even followed by the 'Hello Future' repackage.  --ckrQuerencia - CHUNG HAOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation This being CHUNG HA's first studio album, it was expected to exceed expectations! And oh, it did! The album explored a long list of genres thanks to the album's separation into four sides . Each side gives off different vibes and rhythms, taking the audience on a rollercoaster of emotions! As for the concept, Querencia  is referring to a place where one can be one's true self/or to desire. The album truly does justice to the concept of where you can be your true self with the wide range of meaning into the tracks, making it an album that suits every mood. In some instances, the difficulties of a relationship, that it's OK not to be fine, to show empowerment and confidence, to pick yourself up and come back stronger than those who have betrayed you. At first, I was skeptical of the 21 tracks but I was just blown away! Of course, never doubt Chungha! With hardly any tracks to skip, the album contains everything that fans have come to love about the soloist. I would say my favorite track of the album would be Demente ft. Guaynaa . The melody and lyrics, just awesome! It is an album to remember and revisit no matter how you are feeling because it has something for everyone!  --HobschiskeWhimsical - Jung Jin HyeongOriginal Album I have been well aware of Jung Jin Hyeong's musical talent for a while, but with the artist's first full-length album Whimsical, Jin Hyeong undeniably solidifies his place within the South Korean R&B scene. With all of the songs written and composed by the singer himself and each and every one of them being extremely enjoyable, Jung Jin Hyeong's debut album is a whirlwind of exquisitely performed R&B songs with hints of hip-hop; starting with the title track Back and its groovy sound that is followed by marvelous electric guitar notes--a first for the South Korean artist--that makes a strong start for the album. The participation of crewmates Theo and Blase is requested in No time and Drive respectively, adding an unexpected edge to each song; the former is a darker track led by its slow beat and acoustic guitar sound, the latter being an upbeat disco-inspired song that vaguely reminds me of electronic music legends Daft Punk, which instantly makes it one of my favorites in the album. But my absolute favorite track is presented in the form of Downtown, a Latin-inspired groovy conveyance of a song that urges people to stand up and dance. Jin Hyeong's charms are further extended to Drunken texts, Hours, and Alarm, all different yet equally delightful, with creative lyrics entrusted by the singer's characteristic sweet and mellow vocals. The final song, a pre-released single featuring hip-hop geniuses pH-1 and Sik-K carrying the name of Lies, is the perfect closure to an album like Whimsical, with its catchy chorus and the rappers' additional charisma. It is worth mentioning and recognizing the work of Vangdale, producer of all of the songs in the album, as he was able to seamlessly and flawlessly create different worlds within each song. That being said, Jung Jin Hyeong's debut album, Whimsical, is an assertive piece of work, as it ensures that the listener will be drawn by the artist's witty lyrical work and incredible musical sense.  --loveholicGUESS WHO - ITZYOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation ITZY's 'Guess Who' does a good job communicating a broad theme revolving around the rebellious nature of outlaws. The title track, ma.pi.a.  IN THE MORNING, appears to narrate a sly and cunning woman in love - stealing a heart and using her so-called trickery to get what she wants. The slick  sound of the instrumental towards the beginning perfectly builds upon this. Sorry Not Sorry is an anthem of confidence in their abilities and decisions. There's also clearly a thirst to overachieve, fly past all obstacles, and stop at nothing. The heavy guitar strums really top this one-off. Following is KIDDING ME, which communicates taking a stand against a partner who isn't as committed as you are. The chopped and harsh yet somehow smooth sample that comes in during the chorus communicates strong words and a new beginning perfectly. Wild Wild West communicates the mean side that one may take in a relationship   with a lover that is willing to be there unconditionally even knowing that fact. Some people love a little danger - that's what makes the wild west so appealing. SHOOT! is about shooting your shot with someone you love deeply, but staying true to yourself and not bending to fit their desires. It alludes to the film Red Shoes and the Seven Dwarfs - the attractive allure that Red Shoes had when she put them on. In my opinion, this instrumental is by far the funkiest on the album and the creative use of vocal tuning helps a lot to create the feel. Finally, TENNIS  is a soft, cozy tone change that acts as a send-off for the project. The acoustic and bass sounds build this well. Overall, 'Guess Who' screams healthy confidence with a bit of vulnerability when needed. I'd definitely listen to it again!  --ckrThe Chaos Chapter: FREEZE - TOMORROW X TOGETHEROriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation Leaders of the fourth generation of K-Pop are back with their third full-length album--The Chaos Chapter: FREEZE. The album is very strong in terms of music, and at the same time, the group freely tries different musical genres and styles, which gives a very natural, pleasant-to-the-ear effect. The subject of the songs still oscillates around the highs and lows of their boy lives on the verge of being teens and young adults. It is also significant that all the members were actively involved in the creation of the album, which makes it even more personal--they all wrote the lyrics, and HUENINGKAI co-produced one of the songs  The main point of the album is the title track, an emo-rock song 0X1=LOVESONG  featuring South Korean R&B singer, Seori. The song is followed by the band's first English song, an upbeat, funky Magic, which perfectly emphasizes the dancing abilities of the group during performances. When talking about the best songs from the album, it is impossible not to mention Anti-Romantic, the soft synth-pop ballad that works as the album opener, shows youth's intense feelings of falling in and out of love. The album debuted at No. 5 on Billboard 200 albums chart  making TXT the third K-Pop group in history to chart multiple albums on the chart in the same year, placing them in the company of BTS and TWICE.  --SiannveSummer Queen - Brave GirlsOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation As a fan of Brave Girls when We Ride was released even and before Rollin' gained the huge success, I was really excited to see what other concepts that the current lineup could show since there wasn't really much information about them then. Summer Queen was the perfect example of what I would've been looking for. A mini-album that you could listen to while you're having fun outdoors, or just chilling by yourself during summer! The first track cimasbaram  is an upbeat song that showcases their unique voices, especially in the chorus. In my opinion, the English version of the song gives off a stronger feeling. Overall, it was a really memorable song and Yuna's line Now I'm fearless has been stuck in my head since forever. The album has a promotional b-side called Pool Party which I love a lot because of the retro vibe I get from it. Perfect song if you're going out rollerskating or to a pool party! My favorite on the album na honja yeoreum  is all I could ask for a summer song. Smooth producer tag intro? Check. Memorable lyrics and melody? Check. A catchy verse that Eunji and Yujeong participate in? Check! Now on to FEVER. I love this song a lot, of course! It's one of the most chill songs I've ever listened to in my life and in the most positive way ever. I feel like listening to this song if I ever get a fever honestly. If you're a fan of girl groups that know how to make a variety of good summer songs, I suggest you try Brave Girls out!  --seokyoungTaste Of Love - TWICEOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation Serving as the tenth mini-album from TWICE, Taste Of Love expresses the girl group's maturation as they move away from prior girlish concepts and find themselves confronting intense emotions to coincidental encounters. Notably, it even features writing credits from four out of the nine members: Jihyo, Dahyun, Sana and Nayeon. Beginning with a metaphor for being drunk on love, Alcohol-Free instantaneously sets the summer theme off by its incorporation of elements derived from Bossa nova style of samba. I'd say it'd be the understatement of the year to admit I'm a *little* obsessed with Dahyun and Chaeyoung's rap; their flow is as cool as a mojito with lime on a hot summer's day and I wish it were longer! With First Time, I think we can all relate to the butterflies felt when realizing you're falling in love with somebody. Seductively, the bass guitar allows amplifying these electrifying feelings. I also believe the post-chorus is undeniably catchy with the shouts of hey! In retrospect, the one thing that stood out to me was those heavenly falsettos. Furthermore, Jade Thirwall from Little Mix aided the songwriting on this track, helping to encapsulate the feeling of the one language we're all fluent in: love. Moving on... did Chaeyoungs's whispers catch you off-guard? 'Cause, they sure did for me! The continuation of the groovy guitar pickings in Scandal, this time paired with powerful piano chords, demonstrate TWICE's newfound confidence when exploring a riskier, more flirtatious side of love. In turn, Conversation ventures forwards into a mellow, laidback sound at first. The bubby synth keys help to assist this approach, but when the chorus is reached, we're introduced to a ritzy bassline. Personally, this is my favorite song on the album - albeit the shortest track, standing at just under 2 minutes and 30 seconds, it takes nothing away from the elegance and sensuality TWICE showcase. Baby Blue Love is a real dance-pop vibe, a call-back to the retro 70s/80s shimmering disco-era. Honestly, the urge to get up and dance is almost irresistible. From the title itself, the color baby blue connotes making free-spirited, carefree memories. Finally, SOS is precisely the ending we needed to this saga of infatuation. Closing off with more light-hearted fun and thrills, the girls savoring each and every moment spent with their lover, I didn't think it was possible for TWICE to make a summer-themed album where every track evoked a similar atmosphere, yet was diverse in the manner it was brought out and sung about. Over the years, TWICE have perfected their mellifluous vocals and have been more eager to experiment. If anything, this album is an exquisite example of that, and I am very much excited to create my own memories this summer!  --ZealotOfStockholmRedd - Whee In Original Album | Romanization | English Translation As a big fan of MAMAMOO's R&B vocals and sassy rap verses, I was very excited to check out Whee In's Redd. Starting with the catchy title track watercolor, she gives an empowering message about self-improvement: It's okay to be selfish if it means you're following your dreams and you're staying true to yourself. Then we have Trash, featuring rapper pH-1. The intimate track is about showing the pretty and ugly parts of yourself to the person you love. While that may be scary at first, the undeniable passion ends up winning. Contrasting the previous piece, OHOO is a laid-down love song, perfect to listen to when the sun is setting or when it's raining. If you came for soulful R&B, Butterfly will be your favorite, featuring the great GSoul. The beautiful and calming melodies create a story about finding 'the one' in your dreams and learning to let go so you can wake up from the fantasy. My highlight is the ending, where both vocalists harmonize and create a new atmosphere together. bomi neoege  is a cute love letter to Whee In's fans, where she thanks them for always being there for her and brightening her days. Finally, we have my favorite track off the mini-album, NO THANKS. I tend to love lyrically angsty songs that sound happy, even while tracks like Trash or OHOO are more relatable than ever for me right now.  With Redd, Whee In tells an engaging narrative about learning to know your worth so you can experience the love you deserve at last.  --EleventhCassetteLilac - IUOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation Acting as a bridge between her 20s and 30s, LILAC is a cathartic album by the Korean singer-songwriter, IU. Running with her theme of age-related projects, the singer brings comfort to her fans on this album. Containing extremely relatable lyrics, at least relatable to me and most people I know, LILAC had a track for every moment. Sonically, the album is a perfect modern pop album, from 2000s R&B to 80s disco-pop to soaring orchestral ballads, IU shares every aspect of herself that we have grown to love. While the lead single is an explosion of springtime excitement like the blossoming of lilacs, I think the album's real gems lie in the B-side tracks like Troll featuring R&B artist DEAN , the bubblegum-pop, eopu , Coin, aiwa nayi bada  and Flu. One thing I love about IU's albums is the incredible songwriting collaborations. It shows that she can fit into any style possible, LILAC's credits contain several prominent Korean songwriters including Lee Chan Hyuk, PENOMECO, JUNNY, Sumin, and hitmaker Ryan S. Jhun. IU amplifies her relatable personality through her music and lyrics and LILAC is the perfect example of it.  --ssaa10decSTAYDOM - STAYCOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation After the powerful entrance STAYC made to the K-Pop genre in late 2020, making them my favorite girl group debut of the year, the group's much-anticipated first mini-album STAYDOM was released in April of 2021. Compelled of four songs, this delivery emphasizes the group's intention of making an impact and gaining their own place in the industry. With unmatched vocals and fun choreography, the lead single ASAP is an infectious and bubbly refreshing song that positively assures the group's duality, compared to debut song SO BAD. Though based on my taste, their B-side tracks are what shines the most. The confidence-inducing track with a catchy and melodic tune SO WHAT encourages the listener to be their own self, regardless of other people's opinions. My preferred track, sarangeun weonrae ireohge apeun geongayo  is an easy-to-listen and sweet slow-paced mixture of the members' diverse vocal colors and meaningful lyrics. Both songs reach their peak during the bridge, both unique yet addicting in the same kind of way. Ending with a remix of SO BAD, TAK lends his artistic abilities that make for a song perfect for performances. To say I am excited about STAYC's future releases is very little compared to the relentless anticipation I have as I look forward to the undeniable success that STAYC will face as they dive more into their talent.  --loveholicEpik High Is Here Shang  - EPIK HIGHOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation The calm, the storm, and the duality of the butterfly meet on Epik High is Here Shang . As an ARMY, I've always been aware of the group, but not so much of their music. But just like how the doors open and close as the pandemic progresses for better or for worse, Epik High proves to be a meaningful catch of hope and ambition in spite of the gloomy future. I would like to recap some of my favorite moments of the album. 'Lesson 0, a sentimental song driven by piano chords, describes the search for an answer that might not exist. Ending on a perfect resolution, the song suggests that some solution has been proposed. Coming up right after, Rosario plays with the duality of the butterfly; the song is as mellow as hearing gunshots in close distance. Ambitious and aggressive, and featuring other A-listers in the game, the song is a rose with pointy thorns. The classical instrumental of nae yaegi gata  is as intricate as real love stories themselves. The group wonders why they are reacting so personally to fictional romance; and how ironically, they can only answer with words similar to I don't know nan molla. susangsogam  accepts the pressure of fame; it accepts that just like how Black clouds are still clouds, gold chains are still chains. True Crime is the song with the EDM-infused chorus, the calm before the storm--when you're driving down a peaceful tunnel that you hope is endless. Social Distancing 16 is short and telling about the music industry within 16 bars; the flow is immaculate despite switching between Tablo and Mithra Jin. Tablo's opening rap verse in End of the World is as smooth and delightful as sliding into a diner booth, only then to be served with the truth in his verse.  --ANC613WATERFALL - B.IOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation I was going to choose Numb to be featured in the Songs List, however, it is quite impossible to single out one song to represent the album. I will admit, I am a fairly new fan of Hanbin. I always knew of him as a songwriter, but I never paid attention to his lyrics on a deeper level. Hanbin's ability to share a heartbreaking and depressing story through his lyrics but still make the track sound like a summer bop is perfectly on display on WATERFALL. Hanbin also known as B.I professionally expertly hides his pain in the album's lyrics. Some of the highlights on the album include previously mentioned rock ballad, Numb, Then, Illusion, Help Me and Daydream which also features longtime friend, Lee Hi. Storytelling takes center stage on the album, considering the public scrutiny the artist has faced in the past. Being his first full-length album, WATERFALL becomes an outlet for Hanbin to share his truth. While the production is simple and minimalistic, B.I still incorporates rock, hip-hop, funk, pop, jazz, and ballad sounds in the album. One of my favorite things is when a rapper sings and sounds phenomenal and we hear it once again on the album. The album contains some of B.I's best vocal deliveries and amidst the heartbreak and darkness, Hanbin manages to find hope and light on WATERFALL which is what makes this album one of the best of the year.  --ssaa10decFragile - eAeonOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation eAeon, the Korean singer-songwriter, also known for being the leader of indie band mos , returned after nine years with his solo album, Fragile. The release is a very interestingly working mixture of synth-pop and lo-fi, with very honest, vulnerable lyrics and 'love' as a metaphor to talk about fragility throughout the whole album. One of the most interesting songs are waeilgga , which creates the vibe that could easily be the soundtrack to the film, probably some dark drama or a spy movie, and eojjeomyeon , one of the singles released prior the album, that will make you think about changes, and impact other people make in our lives. For this album, eAeon also collaborated with a R&B singer Jclef , rapper Swervy , and rapper-songwriter-composer RM ). The latter is probably the most known off the album . geureoji ma , the story of the relationship gradually falling apart, is not their first collaboration, and once again they created a very unique piece, as both artists share a similar musical sensitivity, and they hold great respect for each other, which translates into the results of their joint work. That being said, despite the rather gloomy subject of the lyrics, the whole album is oddly comforting and definitely worth listening to as we all have the fragility to embrace. --SiannveTHE FIRST STEP : TREASURE EFFECT - TREASUREOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation TREASURE's first full-length project, THE FIRST STEP : TREASURE EFFECT, showcases the rookies' potential across a multitude of styles. The project includes their first single albums, and I was worried this mesh of drastically different genres would take away from the listening experience. However, the album's musical diversity allows anyone to experience the full treasure effect. TREASURE's first few releases  all followed a YG-style EDM approach, making their mark as YG's newest boy group. Their debut BOY is honestly quite reminiscent of DDU-DU DDU-DU in terms of sound and structure. Though they formed this EDM image, it didn't restrict them from exploring other genres. eum  threw in a hip-hop twist, showcasing more rap than anywhere else on the album. The title track MY TREASURE is a youthful song with an uplifting message, one that fits their group name TREASURE - encouraging listeners to keep their heads high on gloomy days and learn to treasure what they have . The other B-side tracks on the album also have a bit of everything: micyeogane  is a house track reminiscent of BIGBANG-era K-Pop while narang issja  is a guitar-based acoustic song with a bit of bass and a whistle hook-line. Members' diverse talents are showcased as well, with Asahi co-producing the ballad orenji  and Hyunsuk, Haruto and Yoshi writing most of their raps for the album. They also have strong vocals: Jeongwoo and Jihoon showcased their vocal potential on saranghae  and B.L.T , and you can really hear Yedam and his vocals throughout the album; He's finally singing on his own songs. The tracklist is topped off by the Lee Chan Hyuk-penned SLOWMOTION, a slow song dedicated to the group's journey so far. I can't wait to hear what musical direction TREASURE take in the future. This project is diverse, but remember, it's only the first step.  --PlanNine16Instinct Part 1 - OnlyOneOfOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation This rookie almost obscure boy group made a lot of buzz this spring with their unique  concept. OnlyOneOf who debuted in 2019 has always incorporated unique themes and concepts in their releases. For fans of the group, it came as no surprise that the group was once again looking towards combining philosophy, art, and music to create thought-provoking songs. Instinct Part 1 is the group's third mini-album and takes inspiration from Sigmund Freud's theories of mind. Supported by the title track, libidO, Instinct Part 1 explores the themes of intimacy that humans crave especially teenagers. Despite garnering much attention due to its sexy and sensual choreography and visuals, I think it is also important to appreciate the depth in the concept of this album. In a year where most of us were confined to our homes and many times all alone, we all craved intimacy at different levels and in different ways. OnlyOneOf beautifully explored this subconscious drive that we all have on B-side tracks instinct/bonneung and byredO. They also talk about the repercussions of the instinct, both when it becomes overbearing or when it is suppressed. Featuring instrumental interludes, Instinct Part 1 is masterfully crafted making it one of the standout albums of 2021 so far. I truly believe that OnlyOneOf has a bright future credited to their unique discography amplified by their immense talent in the studio and on stage.  --ssaa10decYellow - Kang DanielOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation At 1 AM, I dive straight into this project with no prior knowledge of who KANG DANIEL is and with no familiarity with his music. Now, typically yellow is a vibrant color, symbolizing happiness and joy. However, it seems something dark lurks beneath the surface of this color's pretense - yellow has lost sight of its color and its purpose. What is left is a story that begins with Digital, an astounding intro that gives off The Weeknd-esque vibes. Although it has an upbeat feel, it details the troubles of social media and - thanks to some handy research - specifically the false rumors surrounding Kang before he went on hiatus in November 2019. Moving onto PARANOIA, the heavy strums of the bass guitar combined with the distorted synth sounds link to his fragmented state of mind. No wonder it was released as a single - it scratches the surface of his darkness, preparing us to venture deeper into his mind. Though melancholy, Kang never shies away from drawing from personal experiences, ensuring his songs are relatable to listeners. Misunderstood does exactly that, whilst also marking his first collaboration with rapper Omega Sapien from Balming Tiger, whose voice meshes remarkably well with Kang's. Personally, Antidote is my favorite track. Utilizing a perfect amount of autotune, Kang desperately holds out faith and hope for better days, no matter how hard life treats him. Furthermore, it was written at what Kang cites as rock bottom, making it all the more heartfelt for the fans he never stopped thinking about. Finally, Save U is a beautifully, optimistic end to the color trilogy. The song, aided by rapper Wonstein, puts into perspective the universal struggles faced both in and out of the spotlight. Overall, the album is vehement, yet eloquent. Truthfully, it is mesmerizing without being enigmatic; its somber mood allows us to focus on the messages Kang succeeds to convey, without any word being lost in translation. Finally, I hope Kang knows how loved he is by his worldwide fans and continues to share his story with such passion!  --ZealotOfStockholm - LOONAOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation I will admit, I'm a fairly new Orbit. But from the moment I saw the music video for Why Not?, I immediately fell in love with LOONA. And with their newest comeback, , my opinion of them only increases. Starting from the intro track, &, the album immediately kicks off with an intense electronic sound. Reusing some elements from the lead single, it's powerful, bold, and sharp. Next is the lead single, PTT . With influence from Indian culture and music, this track is has a very intense dance hip-hop sound. LOONA sings about not caring what other people think about you and showing your true colors shamelessly. Showcasing an amazing pre-chorus, and a captivating bridge, with LOONA's vocals, it's an absolutely gorgeous track. After that, we have WOW. A bouncy, upbeat track, LOONA encourages every girl to be proud of who they are, and be themselves without shame. Then, it's Be Honest, my favorite song on the album. A refreshing bop, it's about being honest to yourself and expressing your feelings. In my opinion, LOONA's vocals really shine here, with great melodies and lively raps. Next is the fully English song Dance On My Own. Opening with a simple acoustic guitar, LOONA's vocals have a really nice feel in this song. Then, we have A Different Night - an emotional ballad with a dreamy, sentimental sound. The ad-libs throughout the song enhance the effect nicely. The album ends with U R, a soft R&B song with lo-fi influence. It's a really good song for chilling in your house at night! Overall, this album transitions very nicely - opening with an intense, powerful intro, and ending with a warm, cozy sound. This is definitely one of my favorite albums, everyone should give it a listen! You'll definitely like at least one track on it!  --crystallized_starstimeabout, - YukikaOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation Let's get one thing out of the way first, Japanese K-pop idol Yukika is my all-time favorite solo artist. She mainly makes city pop songs, a genre inspired by Japanese music made usually in the 1980s. 'timeabout,' is her first mini-album, and in my opinion one of the best mini albums ever released. I'm a sucker for city pop so there was already no way I would've disliked anything on the album. It starts with a synth intro called Leap forward which makes me feel like I'm time traveling. Then, it leads on to the title track called Insomnia. The song is a groovy and retro track that you would listen to when you're studying. It makes you feel nostalgic and remember memories. Lovemonth follows after Insomnia, immediately catching your attention from the addictive and upbeat start and leads you on to the addicting chorus. TIME TRAVEL has her signature city pop sound on it, a jazzy-ish chorus with sharp vocals. Secret includes unique melodies that are so unique that it's addicting to listen to. My favorite track on the album, PUNG! is an easy-to-listen-to song with vocals and an instrumental brought from heaven. It's calm and memorable and I personally love everything about it. When you listen to it with headphones on, it feels like you're floating on clouds. There isn't any reason not to check her out! If you've never listened to city pop before, I promise you that it can easily become your favorite genre. Yukika is a great city pop artist to start off with.  --seokyoungUNNATURAL - WJSNOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation From somebody who never listened to WJSN, you might wonder what I listened to, to get into them? It was all because of this album. It all began when my friend recommended this album and shortly, it became one of my favorite albums of all time. This album has many upbeat songs and along with a ballad called REWIND. The title song UNNATURAL is a flashy song and has a catchy and fun hook. The second track called Last dance has an impressive intro with a captivating pizzicato. I personally love the chorus for it as it was stuck in my head for a few days. Moving on to SUPER MOON is another track with an exciting hook. Member Exy took part in writing the rap lyrics which makes it more exciting to listen to. The fourth track in the album titled New Me has to be my favorite track on there. With an ambitious message, It's an extremely captivating retro track that you can never get bored of. I really like retro songs therefore I really loved it. Members Seola and Exy participated in the making of the song. Moving on to the fifth track in the album YALLA once again, member Exy wrote AND composed this song. What a talented girl! Another one of my favorite tracks on the album, YALLA, is an electronic pop song with a hard-hitting drop in its chorus. The last song on the album which is REWIND is a great ballad. Containing the lyrics We will be together forever it is a very meaningful song. Both promoted tracks, UNNATURAL and Last Dance also have beautiful choreographies. In general, the whole album is really fun with memorable hooks and lyrics. So whenever you're planning on having a party or doing karaoke, you should try playing this album. I really recommend that you listen to this album if you haven't already as you would definitely be impressed.  --WongkaheiDUALITY - I.MOriginal Album | Romanization | English Translation Yes, he served us looks, a fiery flow, and some questionable lyrics, but underneath all that, I.M of MONSTA X delivered some of the most vulnerable moments on his mixtape, DUALITY. Sticking to the theme of the project, Changkyun shares how there are always two sides to a story. He expresses how every emotion whether good or bad has multiple sides to it. The mixtape was promoted with the smooth hip-hop lead single, God Damn. In line with the concept, I.M masterfully cloaks the song with explicit lyrics and sexual innuendos but also manages to add deeper self-reflective layers to it. Howlin' finds I.M once again dealing with conflicting feelings about being alone. Known as a sexy R&B crooner, I.M takes a much darker route on Burn and Happy To Die talking about mental health and the toll that his glamorous idol life takes on him. The album's resident melodic rap ballad, sideun ggoc  is a somber track written from the perspective of the person left behind after a relationship withers away. With DUALITY, I.M shows a different side to himself. The mixtape highlights his strengths as a rapper and a songwriter. Oftentimes, I.M's sincerity is lost behind their hard-hitting verses in MONSTA X songs, which is why DUALITY is an even more special project because it allowed him to open himself up to his fans and audience and put himself in a different light.  --ssaa10decNOIR - U-KNOW Original Album | Romanization | English Translation I'm a big TVXQ! fan, my IQ on both TVXQ! & TOHOSHINKI is over 3000, that aside I really love this album. I love the robotic feeling of the opening track Time Machine and his harmonization with those Ah-a-a-a-a-a-ah make his robotic voice pop. Up comes most likely my favorite track off the album Thank U first off I love the MV with the elevator fight scene, him slashing everyone and the border falling, the One-In-The-Chamber scene and how cinematic the whole vibe is. The song is also great, I like the first part of the instrumental where it's gloomy and it sounds amazing. As well as the dynamic in his voice where he is singing then he's sounds more further away and more sad. Also the solo sax part is just ear candy. Onto the next track Eeny Meeny is a really good pace changer, from being quite tense to being playful and the instrumental after the second chorus is my favorite part and goes back to the normal instrumental seamlessly. Eeny Meeny made one thing strong a fun vibe and Loco House Party made that theme much more clearer. Having a tropical and fun vibe is honestly great but there is no standout moment in the track. You know the theme that Eeny Meeny made and Loco House Party expanded on? Being upbeat and fun? Need You Right Now just throws that out the window but It's a nice track and is a good ballad-ishy song. But the track suffers from the same flaw as the last one, no stand out moments. The theme Need You Right Now stopped it actually made another being ballad-ish sounding songs or sounding more sad with La Rosa but the last 3 tracks all suffer from the same thing Not Having A Standout Moment. And that's a big flaw no track is bad mind you but the first 3 make a really good start but then has a bit of a slump. But the biggest flaw is that there's no theme throughout the whole album. . . But it is my favorite K-Pop album of the year so... A+  -OKRA233",

I exchange thoughts with the clouds I hold my breath Ahh, it's just hard shell you can't see Is that where the bottom is? The shadow burns me Ahh, I just want to keep forgetting Slip your desires into the ants' nest Come now, all you have to do now is be reborn again  Let tomorrow sleep and peacefulness will turn to you Free yourself and go with your razor sharp emotions Even the twisted flow is the proof that you are alive I invite the tearfully-indulging tomorrow  The inculcated Dogra Magra The pain of the mark and the one and only personality And those colorful eyes all decorated I don't want them anymore Is hypocrisy going to come and take it away? The lonely red stage at night I dedicate the following to the aspiring leading actor That's where the truth is  The small corner of my un-cheatable heart says I still want to be here Who can't we forgive? I let them hear my cold voice And i swear  I will live with my work I scream with this body of flesh that separates heaven and hell I carve the sins What will be the proof of my existence if it disappears with the wind?  I've stared at the strong shining moon long enough to be bored Can't even turn myself into a werewolf But just enough to become crazy by the darkness I want to suck the neck The emptiness of the remains I won't let you sleep At the age where you just want attention...tonight I might go crazy for you.  Everyone wants to reach out their hand and grab happiness But they just end up becoming the monster that lies deep in darkness The end has already come to life It will take form at zero and will crawl back into the uterus and rot Every time this happens your faces crumble  No one wants to talk about truth that hurts the ear The suppressed minds  Compensate the sins and let life be gone  The emptiness of the antithesis Becomes the choking and crying land Bury the bones in the common land immersed in thesis Be burdened by depression The gritty tsunami takes me away and I smile with bitter tears Couldn't understand the value of things The hanging of the necks at the 13 stairs Seeing people becoming friendly while clapping hands That mixes in with sissy thoughts and hurts others Seeing you like this it's just too sad  Splash of blood Squashing basic instincts Talk about death  I will live with my work I scream with this body of flesh that separates heaven and hell I carve the sins. What will be the proof of my existence if it disappears with the wind?  No one wants to talk about the truth that hurts the ear The suppressed minds  Compensate the sins, and let life be gone  Is it a sin for me to live because I am evil?",

And I want to believe  I think I hear it laughing But it sounds like my voice lost and old I think it showed me Heaven And now I know why I'm scared to die  Am I a fool in the dark, I don't know Am I the ghost in my dreams, I don't know Am I a shadow of life, I don't know Am I afraid of the truth, I don't know  Sometimes I call out for you, and sometimes I'm afraid  So I ask for One small mercy? But it whispers 'Who are you?'  So I ask God If He can save me? He says 'It's all too dark'",

        "How could I have led these men To their demise and they just follow? Exploration's last great prize It wasn't mine And more's the shame You will remember my name Great God, this is an awful place I do not think that we can hope For any better things now Oh, the end, cannot be far It cannot be far, I cannot wait Explorations last great prize A saving grace, it wasn't mine And more's the shame You will remember my name And more's the shame You will remember my name",
        "Birdhouse in Your Soul  I'm your only friend I'm not your only friend But I'm a little glowing friend But really I'm not actually your friend But I am   Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch Who watches over you Make a little birdhouse in your soul Not to put too fine a point on it Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet Make a little birdhouse in your soul   I have a secret to tell From my electrical well It's a simple message and I'm Leaving out the whistles and bells So the room must listen to me Filibuster vigilantly My name is blue canary One note spelled l-i-t-e My story's infinite Like the Longines Symphonette It doesn't rest  Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch Who watches over you Make a little birdhouse in your soul Not to put too fine a point on it Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet Make a little birdhouse in your soul   I'm your only friend I'm not your only friend But I'm a little glowing friend But really I'm not actually your friend But I am   There's a picture opposite me Of my primitive ancestry Which stood on rocky shores And kept the beaches shipwreck-free Though I respect that a lot I'd be fired if that were my job After killing Jason off And countless screaming Argonauts Blue bird of friendliness Like guardian angels it's Always near  Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch Who watches over you Make a little birdhouse in your soul Not to put too fine a point on it Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet Make a little birdhouse in your soul While you're at it Keep the nightlight on inside The birdhouse in your soul Not to put too fine a point on it Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet Make a little birdhouse in your soul While you're at it Keep the nightlight on inside The birdhouse in your soul  Make a little birdhouse in your soul While you're at it Keep the nightlight on inside The birdhouse in your soul Not to put too fine a point on it Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet Make a little birdhouse in your soul15",

        "New Birds You just have to be sure you're doing the right thing. I mean it's very easy to forget - she was just sitting there in the pub with her new friends and her new life and her new hair, and it might have been five years but you'd know just to look at her  I wasn't even sure it was her at first; I was ready to walk away but she smiled and called me over and we said hello for a bit. When we went back to our tables we were trying not to look over at each other and told our friends to stop staring. I didn't see her for the rest of the night, but by closing time the beer's kicked in so I go up and speak to her and we end up going for a walk, and talking about our new homes, our new jobs, our new friends, and our new birds  She said she'd been going out with him now for about two and a half years, but they don't live together so he'd never find out. And you think about chasing her about school when you were wee and lying in your bed and listening to love songs and pretending they were about you. And the first time you asked her out she said no but one night you went to a wedding and when you came back to the pub she'd changed her mind and you went out. You remember the way she swung her arms when she held your hand but you can't remember how she kissed and now you've got the chance to find out  But you have to remember there's this other kiss and she's sittin' at home wondering where you are and what you're doing. And you worked hard on this kiss and you know it inside out; it's as much yours as it is hers, and it took a long time to get right, it took months of practice and months of embarrassment, but now you've got it perfected and you've been looking forward to that kiss all week You can see her breath in the air between your faces, as you stand in the leaves and she just asks you straight out if you want to come and stay at her flat. But you make sure you get separate taxis and you go home and there might be a slight regret and maybe you'll wonder what you missed, but you have to remember the kiss that you worked so hard on. And you'll know you've done the right thing1",

The snake was pale gold, glazed and shrunken We were afraid to touch it The sheets were hot dead prisms And she was beside me Old, she's no, young Her dark red hair, the white soft skin Now, run to the mirror in the bathroom Look! she's coming in here I can't live through each slow century of her moving I let my cheek slide down, the cool smooth tile Feel the good cold stinging blood The smooth hissing snakes of rain Once I had a little game I liked to crawl back in my brain I think you know, the game I mean I mean the game, called, 'Go insane' You should try this little game Just close your eyes forget your name Forget the world, forget the people And we'll erect, a different steeple This little game is fun to do Just close your eyes, no way to lose And I'm right there, I'm going too Release control, we're breaking through Way back deep into the brain Back where there's never any pain And the rain falls gently on the town And over the heads of all of us And in the labyrinth of streams Beneath, the quiet unearthly presence of Gentle hill dwellers, in the gentle hills around Reptiles abounding Fossils, caves, cool air heights Each house repeats a mold, windows rolled Beast car locked in against morning All now sleeping Rugs silent, mirrors vacant Dust Lying under the beds of lawful couples Wound in sheets And daughters, smug With semen eyes in their nipples Wait There's been a slaughter here Don't stop to speak or look around Your gloves and fan are on the ground We're getting out of town, we're going on the run And you're the one I want to come Not to touch the earth Not to see the sun Nothing left to do, but Run, run, run Let's run, let's run House upon the hill, moon is lying still Shadows of the trees Witnessing the wild breeze C'mon baby run with me Let's run Run with me Run with me Run with me Let's run The mansion is warm at the top of the hill Rich are the rooms and the comforts there Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs And you won't know a thing till you get inside Dead President's corpse in the driver's car The engine runs on glue and tar C'mon along, we're not going very far To the East to meet the Czar Run with me Run with me Run with me Let's run Some outlaws lived by the side of the lake The minister's daughter's in love with the snake Who lives in a well by the side of the road Wake up, girl! We're almost home We should see the gates by mornin' We should be inside by evening Sun, sun, sun Burn, burn, burn Burn, burn, burn I will get you Soon, soon, soon I am the lizard king I can do anything We came down The rivers and highways We came down from Forests and falls We came down from Carson and Springfield We came down from Phoenix enthralled And I can tell you The names of the Kingdom I can tell you The things that you know Listening for a fistful of silence Climbing valleys into the shade For seven years, I dwelt In the loose palace of exile Playing strange games with the girls of the island Now, I have come again To the land of the fair and the strong and the wise Brothers and sisters of the pale forest Children of night Who among you will run with the hunt? Now night arrives with her purple legion Retire now to your tents and to your dreams Tomorrow we enter the town of my birth I want to be ready3",
        "Medicine Bottle Giving in to love And sharing my time Letting someone into my misery I told it all step by step  How I landed on the island And how I swim across the sea And it crosses my mind That I may awake to a knife in me No more breath in my hair or ladies underwear Tossed up over the alarm clock Blood dripping from the bed to a neatly written poem Heartfelt last line reading There is no more mystery Is it going to happen, my love? There is no more mystery Is it going to happen, my love?  It's all in my head, she said, Morning after nightmare You're building a wall, she said, Higher than the both of us So try living life instead of hiding in the bedroom Show me a smile and I'll promise not to leave you  It happened under a rainy cloud Passing through the dark South We went into a big house And slept in a small bed I didn't know you then As well as you of me We talked of our sad lives And we went on separately  And we went on separately I found your overseas souvenirs Holiday greeting cards Those long forgotten high school fears It's all in my head, I said Banging on the piano I've not been so alone I thought, since kicking in the womb I drank so much tea I wrote my letters in kanji Around the block I walked and walked Pretending you were with me  Not wanting to die out here Without you  The hurting never ends Like birthdays and old friends, we forget That this flesh blood and bone is human Trading phone lines for airlines Unwilling to face That love is found on the inside Not the outside And like a medicine bottle In the cabinet, I'll keep you And like a medicine bottle In my hand I will hold you  And swallow you slowly As to last me a lifetime Without holding too tight I do not want to lose  The thrill that it gives me To look out from my window And scowl at the houses From my world in the bedroom  It's all in his head, she read In a girlfriend's self-help book It's all his own making A war with himself  Like two sides of a wall That separates two countries He shuts out the world he once knew To love you  Not wanting to die out here Without you Not wanting to die out here Without you4",

No, do it once again  I was handsome, I was strong I knew the words of every song Did my singing please you? No, the words you sang were wrong  Who is it whom I address?

        "The Light at the End of the World An isle, a bright shining isle Stands forever, alone in the sea Of rock and of sand and grass And shale, the isle bereft of trees  - Small. A speck in the wide blue Sea. 'Tis the last of all the land A dweller upon our lonesome Isle, the last, lonely man? -  By the Gods he is there to Never leave, to remain all his Life. His punishment for Evermore, to attend the Eternal light  The lighthouse, tall and brilliant White, which stands at the end Of the world. Protecting ships And sailors too, from rock they Could be hurled  Yet nothing comes and nothing Goes 'sept the bright blue sea Which stretches near and far Away, 't is all our man can see Though, one day, up high on Rock, a bird did perch and cry An albatross, he shot a glance And wondered deeply, why?  Could it be a watcher sent? A curse sent from the Gods Who sits and cries and stares at him The life that they have robbed  Each year it comes to watch Over him, the creature from above Not a curse but a reminder of The woman that he loved  - Oh weary night, under stars He'd lay and gaze Up towards the moon and stars The suns dying haze  Time and again, Orion's light Filled our man with joy Within the belt, he'd see his love Remembering her voice -  The twinkle from the stars above Bled peace into his heart As long as she looks down on him He knows they'll never part One day good, one day bad The madness, the heat, the sun Out to sea, he spies upon land His beloved Albion  Cliffs of white and trees of green Children run and play 'My home land' he cries and weeps Why so far away?  Eyes sore and red. Filled with tears He runs towards the sea To risk his life, a worthy cause For home he would be  Into the sea, deep and blue The waters wash him clean Awake. He screams. Cold with sweat And Albion a dream  - Such is life upon the isle Of torment and woe One day good. One day bad And some days, even hope  The light at the end of the world Burns bright for mile and mile Yet tends the man, its golden glow In misery all the while? For fifty years he stands and waits Atop the light, alone Looking down upon his isle The Gods have made his home -  The watcher at the end of the world Through misery does defile Remembers back to that single night And allows a tiny smile    Her hair, long and black it shone The dark, beauty of her eyes Olive skin and warm embrace Her memory never dies  'Twas years ago, he Remembers clear The life they once did live Endless love and lust for life They promised each would give  Alas, such love and laughter too Was short as panting breath For one dark night, her soul Was kissed By the shade of death   Who tends the light now Burning bright On the very last of land   He cursed the Gods and man And life And at his heart he tore  - A deity felt sympathy And threw our man a light 'Your woman you may see again For a single night. -  But think hard and well young man There is a price to pay: To tend the light at the end of The world Is where you must stay  Away from man and life and love Alone you will be On a tiny isle. A bright shining isle In the middle of the sea.'  - 'I'll tend the light, for one more night With the woman whom I love' Screamed the man, with tearful eyes To the deity above  And so it was that very night His lover did return To his arms and to their bed Together they did turn  In deepest love and lust and passion Entwined they did fall Lost within each other's arms They danced . -  - Long was the night filled with love For them the world was done Awoke he did to brightest light His woman and life had gone  To his feet he leapt. To the sea he looked To the lighthouse on the stone The price is paid and from now on He lives forever alone  Fifty years have passed since then And not a soul has he seen But his woman lives with him still In every single dream  'Tis sad to hear how young love has died To know that, alone, someone has cried But memories are ours to keep To live them again, in our sleep.-",

You must wonder why I'm relentless and all strung out I'm consumed by the chill of solitary I'm like Estella I like to reel it in and then spit it out I'm frustrated by your apathy  And I am frightened by the corrupted ways of this land If only I could meet the maker And I am fascinated by the spiritual man I'm humbled by his humble nature, yeah   And what I wouldn't give to find a soulmate Someone else to catch this drift And what I wouldn't give to meet a kindred Ah, aao, aao, aao, aa, aah   Enough about me, let's talk about you for a minute Enough about you, let's talk about life for a while The conflicts, the craziness and the sound of pretenses falling All around, all around   Why are you so petrified of silence? Here, can you handle this? Did you think about your bills, your ex, your deadlines Or when you think you're gonna die? Or did you long for the next distraction?

        "Look for the Woman Chorus: There's a weight over me today Something I have to say Love you too much to leave Don't like you enough to stay  My heads in a mess and I'm stressed But I guess it's a test In the quest for happiness And the rest of that mess So I best just acquiesce Even though I've grown tired of you  And that ain't meant to sound spiteful I just try to be insightful When I write all my emotions In the night all the stuff I try to fight Will just come out and the sad fact is I'm so tired of you  Love, it's a weird thing ain't it? There's no way to explain it But I swear as well as pain There should be joy but we sustain The same level of mundane And it's numbing me through I often wonder if I'd miss you And have the urge to kiss you If an issue was to hit through To this heart that now feels disused And said issue was too big to just ignore And I walked out on you  The chances are I'd fall apart And suffer seizures of the heart As my chest begins to smart The very second have to part I want to go back to the start But then again maybe I just feel new Maybe I'd get my life on track And start to focus my attack On all the things my life just lacks And start to claw my passion back Instead of living like a hack Half committed half relaxed I'd have nothing to lose  Chorus   I guess lately I've had too much time to think And yeah way too much drink When paper meets the ink Over-thinking is the chink in my armour That's just what I do And I've always been that way Forever questioning each day And every plea that's made That maybe when I lay My busy mind will make me prove By finding problems and reasons That might not even be true See we got together so young Before our real lives had begun But flowers don't grow up as one Each finds its own route to the sun And that's exactly what we've done We've grown up separately too And for a few years now it's been the problem And these realisations, I wish that I could stop them But I've realised that love is all we have in common And deep down you know that's true  But then surely that I'm still in love with you Means there's something we can do To get us through and to pursue A brand new point of view On how this gap grew, between me and you  So there's a weight over me and I'd hate to have to leave But in fate I don't believe and the state of you and me Isn't great as you can see So I'll keep thinking this through  Chorus 1",
        "Ripples in the Mesh - The Radioplay   They have visited us from the dawn of time. And one can always read the signs. Their rebirth into our world is always coursed with famine, plague and death. Their latest manifestation, which seems to have been the most powerful, happened in the midst of 20th century depression in Central America. A child suffers from terrible nightmares. Nightmares that was so fiercely overwhelming that they became, aware of themselves.  And they could even experience our realm through a lucid state. They learn to manifest themselves.  And they studied, and watched, and schemed. Then grew and grew stronger and grew greater till they finally announced their arrival to the world AS! ...  ...A highly successful multi-billionaire dollar soda pop industry.  And their overwhelming success was so magnificent, so unnervingly final, that they soon heaved more power and capital than any country worth mentioning. And they were eccentric, and they would paint the clouds and grow strange things and even scoop proud cities from the Earth, made to float and follow the golden sun!  The Constructus Corporation presents: the Ziggurat.    The Ziggurat, a giant floating megalopolis of comfortable living, housed four autonomous societies and over a billion people. It was filled with more exciting personalities than a pomegranate is of pips! But for now, consider these two boys:  First: Randomboy -- A tight young MC and a natural leader, who in time would change the world for ever.  And secondly: his best friend, the Kidtronic.  Now, when studying Kidtronic it is vitally important to consider the following: him and his sister were orphans, and were raised by virtual parent personalities supplied by Constructus. Uhm, now. At the age of seven, he had re-written their program instructions and changed the parental shapes from loving moms and dads into two big fluffy bears that generally just acted silly and entertained his baby sister Anica.  At the age of 8 and a half, he was arrested by the Constructus assistants for the first time. His crime? He had hi-jacked two sprinter wet-wires servers and was using them to embezzle third-decimal credit to his sister's favorite virtual celebrities. It was the first in a series of five arrests.  Now, as you'd probably noticed, he was a complete genius with all the tech- and cyber-reality. Kidtronic also designed games for devices called playgrounds, which covered your eyes and ears. He was also paid annual tributes by all the banks in the Ziggurat for not bankrupting them.  Now c'mon! Let's see what he's up too. Oh! He's sleeping. Dreaming. Changing, into what he will soon become.     ZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZzZz  Wait were am I? Breakfast table. Before school. A Mom and a dad. Anica. She's feeding us eggs. I don't wanna eat eggs. My dad's on the table. ARGH! He's cutting my hand. ARGHGHGG! My Brain! Uh uh uh uh uh!    Almost at that precise moment, thirteen years before, in a secret hide-away 3 kilometers under the Himalayas, the CEO of Constructus International, a certain Mr. Kiriaku was in a meeting with the eyeless, prophet-witch named Next  ]  Ahhhhhhhhh  Ah hahhafghghghha ! Lord. There will be danger ahg ...  Ehh  Too much static uirghghg. Disturbance.  Lord it is fast. Thirteen years from this moment.  Lord, it seems to be invisible. All I can make out is... ripples. Ripples in the Mesh.  I cannot, the pattern that the chaos weaves is too frantic, too - rand- AURGH One will rise that will earn friends... The  time , and your blood       And that very same day, two children were born on two different places on the Ziggurat. One, to loving family; and other to a multi-national corporation. But right now back to our story  Kidtronic had woken up and was loading his new game Long Street onto his playground. He wanted to show it to his friend Randomboy. He was hoping that they might get a chance to play it on the way to the emceeing competition. He was feeling a little nervous because him and Randomboy had both entered the competition. It was very prestigious, and the biggest of its kind yet. At the moment, he was concentrating on the show, doing some breathing exercises when his sister entered the room, without warning.    BOO!  ARGH. Oh jeez, you scared the bejebus out of me. Don't do that.  So, where you going huh 'Tronic?  Nowhere.  Yes you are! You're going to that emceeing competition aren't you?  No I'm not.  Ohoh ! Please can I come with you, PLEeeeeease!? No Anica, you're too young.  I'm not! Please, I won't bug you I swear, I sweaaaaar!  No  I promise, I won't even stand close to you guys  Anica stop, I said no and that's final. I'm leaving - Bye-bye  Oh he's such a stupid punk. I hate him! He never takes me, anywhere! But I love you Mr. Rockadopolis    Uhm, yeah. I love you too Anica. I whip that kid's ass.  No! You mustn't Mr Rockadopolis. They shouldn't know that you're real. I hate him. Did you know that he suffers from epilepileptic... ehhhpelepileptic ... E-E-EPILEPILEPTIC seizures?! No, you wouldn't. Only me and Randomboy knows that. He doesn't want anybody to know. When they happen, he makes himself disappear. And I especially hate it when he disappears. Ah, forget him! I`m going.    On the way to Randomboy house...    He suffers from seizures  I am inside of you Jeez, what was that? I feel fine What is he becoming?   Randomboy opened his front door, and there stood Kidtronic, ridiculously punctual as usual.    Yo, Randomboy, said Kidtronic through his electronic telepathic interface.  Yo  Check this out, he continued, whilst downloading a game into Randomboy's playground. I made this last night. It's called 'Long Street'. I am the Ju-Ju man. You are Snufflegruff, which I still think is whack. You should make up your own-  Hey man, interrupted Random Boy, we've been through this already.  Yeah, well anyway, You must try and defeat me. Biter.  Boo!  Don't do that Anica!  Yo, Randomboy! What's up? Hey!  Hey 'sup Anica!  Go home.  No! I come with.  No, go home. Go play with your dolls.  I don't play with dolls!  Then what is this. Hahahah.  Mr Rockadopolis is not a doll! HE'S A MONSTER!  Don't be so mean. Give the doll back to her.  Hey look, Anica. we're gonna be performing so you can't hang with us. An' there's gonna be too many people so, you can't go by yourself. But I know my grandma and some friends are going so...I mean, you can go with them.  I can look after myself.  No you can't.  They're old! And I want to hang with you guys.  No! No buts. We're leaving. I'll see you later , Nics.    Those these guys think that I'm just some stupid little girl. I mean, Kidtronic wouldn't even let me play with the new game he made last night. Bong street or something. And now he won't even let me to come with! It's not fair! I take those punk dicks out any day at MC-ing Yeah, watch me flipititititit...  Some of the characters in my dreams have nightmares Who took it upon themselves to trick me Into believing they were real Now I'm taking them out, one by one Gorse monster play with prey just for fun, here we come! Three strange meta-morphing hoodoos 'bout to rearrange, the realm of the nunus Everybody dudus, undo the voodoo Like Cookoo heh boo boo, good morning You can't fuck with the frequency It's squeaky clean, dream of me Creeping sneakily through your dream machine Anica the snuffling, chuckling, bubbling, snuggling, tugging, bugging ... unplugging, Ugly fluffy-toy duckling, hugging sucklings  I move in and out of bodies freely Nobody can see me Creepy-crawly heebie-jeebie Getting all touchy-feely La la la la la...  What the hell is that? Something strange is going on? Get away. I don't want you going in the woods again, yeah, I'm warning you.  The people of Long Street lived very simple lives They had wonderful natures, they were never impolite Up until the day the Ju-ju man, came to town now check it out, as I break-it-down. Mrs. Lekkerlegs. Was busy hanging her washing on the line So, what happened next was definitively like the last thing on her mind An unfamiliar voice behind her said: How do you do? Erhm I'm very well thanks she replied but now, who are you? The strange character in a top hat and a long black coat Introduced himself politely, and then said on that note I'd like to show you another something that I doubt you've ever seen Take a look at this, beautiful machine The strange little gadget started changing like magic And cleverly made its way up to the clothes line And in a blink of eye it removed the clothes, and span them around 'til they were dry And they all folded very neatly, in no time Eummh some Mrs. Lekkerlegs was quite taken back Very curious about this mysterious character in black Very soon the whole town was making the scene About the Ju-ju man and his amazing machine Something very, extra ordinary, is going to happen at the Long Street carnival Don't wanna tell you what gives you that impression, he's crazy Something very, extra-ordinary is going to happen at the Long Street carnival Wh-what you talkin' about?  The next day the Ju-ju man went walking through town Unaware of what everybody was talking about He had some time to kill before his appointment a little later with the mayor. So he took this opportunity to socialize a bit And just between you and me the most surprising shit It's about that spark, that strangest things have a habit of coming out the dark But just when you expect them least umumu Lies never rest in peace, anyway Today was kind like, quite an important day Oh everybody has come to see the Ju-ju man special present for the mayor He greeted crowd with a bow that open, his big fat sack. And that tack. Presented the mayor with a black backpack. Everybody standing round went oohhh ! Mayor put it on, and I was like ummhh. What does it do? All of a sudden two long white arms with red button at the end, Extended at the end of the back-pack Grab a 'hold of them my friend. The mayor follow this instruction and felt the power surge As the special metal wings emerged And everybody cried out with glee as The mayor took off clumsily, like a bumblebee Something very, extra-ordinary is going to happen at the Long Street carnival Wh-what you talkin' about? Keep an eye about that  You know whatever, I'm trying to do my work. Shut up Something very, extra-ordinary is going to happen at the Long Street carnival Wh-what you talkin' about? Hey, hey, I'm here. How many times am I.. C'mon. C'mon man. Have some consideration.  Now meanwhile in the woods  Now Snufflegruff called an important meeting with a boom-band Something's fun is going on, we better do something about it soon man There's a humongous metal fungus spreading and everyone's acting weird I'm just trying to think of all this We're the only ones who can see it We've gotta do something to get everyone's attention and Hit them with our supernatural frequencies selections We can build thing in the back of my Grandpa's Donkey-Kong. And take a nice cruise through town with a fat beats bumping hard But we can call it, ummh, oi, the Long Street carnival Cause I know that Ju-ju man is definitely up to, something horrible Ok, we got, quite a lot of stuff to do so, c'mon let's get busy The big fish is about to get taken out by some crazy little fishes  Get ready, let's do this The big day arrived as advertised and everybody goes with the festive vibe If the sun rose, the best the sky was shining extra bright. Snuffing  his mind mesmerized these humans with his magnificent vibrations Even some visitors from afar were like man, isn't this amazing The speakers bumped, as the boom-band freaked the funk And all the smiling people feeling the song Singing along, without a care in the world all shouting and clapping All entirely unaware of what was about to happen. Something very, extra-ordinary is going to happen at the Long Street carnival  Oh listen old man, c'mon man you're being a pain in the ass Can you please just, for one second Something very, extra-ordinary is going to happen at the Long Street carnival Get out that, quick get out. I can't work with you here. That  please leave. Gaurds! Huh. Goodness Gracious  The Boom-band blew beautifully that sunny afternoon The day the machine stopped working was the day no one will forget it soon A terrible,dreadful cry pierced through the Long Street carnival As the Ju-ju man emerged from his brand new house on the hill The crowd took on a new alien voice As the Boom-band's physical vibe revealed his true form People screamed as the evil fiend morphed into some kind of park-town-prawn-like monster with and excruciatingly high-pitched screech like when you cook a lobster  But the boom-band just kept on playing And the creature rose up into the air and started spraying This disgusting yellow smelly stuff as it flew back to its master With his tail between his legs and everyone lived happily ever after The End.    Come on guys! How many times am I gonna have to tell you. No play-grounding in the yellow zone  Thank goodness and assistant!  So it looks like I'm gonna have to... confiscate them, so uh.. do the right thing and hand them over.  No, you cannot remove my friend's playground from his face!  Who's gonna stop me?  Well obviously not me. I mean, just look how big you are. You must work out? Isn't that right Kidtronic?  Oh Randomboy, I don't feel well  You cannot remove my friends playground face. You see, there was a random chi surge a while ago while we were playing a game and it seriously messed up Kidtronics power wire. I mean, just look at him. If you remove it now, you might do some serious damage to my friends' eyes and ears. That is why I too am wearing my playground. Not just to look cool. No, but to rather let Kidtronic hack into my head, and well, soothe my sense to stop the pain. Oh man, the, ooh- the unbearable pain. Isn't that right, Kidtronic?  Ack- it's a seizure  No man, just look we really have to go now. You see, it's to go see uh..  Snufflegr-  Yes! Dr. Snufflegruff. So if yous- would you be so kind as to handcuff yourself to that tree, just look over there- Yes, please. Okay. Okay, thank you very much. We're going now.    And off they went...    Oh, phew. That was close. Good acting Kidtronic. Man- hey, yo, you can stop acting like that now, yo he's gone. Yo 'tronic, what the hell is going on? Do you hear me or something?  Get away from me... Random Boy! Ow!  Just Breathe  Open the door. Just do it. Stop it!  No, no, don't do that.  There is something inside me. Help me. Random- random ripples in the mesh.  Wha..Why?  Come closer Snufflegruff. Random Boy, get back. Stay Random Boy. My name is Kai.  Kai, hmm.  I have lay dormant in the mind of Kidtronic for 13 years. He is a mere vessel.  Hmm.. oh And he has fulfilled his task beautifully, to seek out the ripple maker. To find him, attach himself to me who weaves the random chaos pattern that could undo all that Constructus had done. And this final threat, this natural abomination, this ripple in the mesh...is you Random Boy.  Oh, far out.  See? We are the same. We were destined to collide. My very purpose was to meet you. For you see, random boy, you are life, and I am death, and this, is our beautiful union!  That sounds like a cool game. What's it called?  Die Random Boy! Die!  'Die. Random Boy. Die?' Isn't that..?      And so Random Boy's shadow gets knocked the f-*bleep* out of him.   Cool, that's cool. And put that *bleep* in. And we should even leave in the ra...............",

        "Oh, Johnny was a tall man but his memory was short He'd forget to duck at doorways and often he'd get hurt I took good care of him for he had no family Actually he did, but he forgot who they be Johnny often liked to go out on the town He'd forget where he'd be going so he'd just wander around I when he was back for I would hear the smack Of his head hitting the doorway but tonight it was alack Johnny came home headless, it was a great disgrace But wherever it's a-lying there's a smile upon his face I should have seen it coming, he finally lost his mind But if his head don't turn up soon then all his hats are mine  Johnny came towards me but suddenly he stopped As if trying to think of something but having no luck Still he didn't notice that his head weren't there 'Til he took out a brush and tried to comb his hair I said, Johnny where's your cranium? but he didn't seem to know He just shrugged his shoulders and tried to find his nose And the sight of him there topless made me start to cry For I feared we'd ne'er again see eye to eye Johnny came home headless, it was a great disgrace But wherever it's a-lying there's a smile upon his face I should have seen it coming, he should have stayed in bed For now I fear he'll spend his life just trying to get ahead Refusing to believe that he had split for good His lower half and me searched the neighbourhood It soon became apparent that his head we wouldn't find it He could not retrace his steps, he was absent minded Well years went by til late one night I heard a voice I swore Was Johnny calling out to me, I flung open the door Johnny's head was home, it took a taxi cab Alas, it was too late, his body had gone bad Johnny's head was homeless, his body was cremated And the funeral was harder than he had anticipated I should of seen it coming he said in his eulogy But never thought I'd have to say I ain't got no-body  Johnny came home headless, it was a great disgrace But now his head's upon a shelf, a smile upon his face But now his head's upon a shelf, a smile upon his face",

        "And With Her Came the Birds Night falls, silence takes a grip Guilt I retrieved, a burning will to die I need this to be over before I am bleeding dry  Somewhere along the highway these tracks must end I pass a crowd on my way to the house on the hill  Dead man with pitchfork arms tells me all that he knows Leave me here for the crows In the Fall she came back, and with her the birds",
        "Gu Dong   The sadness on the face will probably be gone tomorrow When did my eyes become dead?  What is waiting for me tomorrow as I sing and live without meaning? Alone in my room as my heartbeat screams Don't kid yourself and don't fool yourself  I am addicted to the perceived fate I am alone I linger on to this fate Don't kid yourself don't wound yourself  The unstoppable rain The unstoppable sound The unstoppable scar The unstoppable love The unstoppable song... I can't stop it anymore I can't handle it anymore  Kill the voice Close your eyes Drown in the darkness Roam around I won't depend on anyone anymore Kill the voice Close your eyes Drown in the darkness Roam around I keep inside me your keen voice... All in darkness  It's such an irony this sunny bright weather - Good Morning -",

Coloring the sky, and the trees And the clouds, and the moonlight I'd color your heart If you didn't, I did Now you are so lonely You are so alone You're so alone You're so lonely, so lonely You are so alone You're so You're so lonely, so lonely And I wish you could just find home"
