We teach old hearts to break One morning I woke up alone The hospital and the nurses gone Have I carved enough my Lord? Child, you are a bone  I ate and ate and ate No, I did not miss a plate, well How much do these suppers cost? We'll take it out in hate  I spent my hatred everyplace On every work on every face Someone gave me wishes And I wished for an embrace  Several girls embraced me, then I was embraced by men Is my passion perfect? No, do it once again  I was handsome, I was strong I knew the words of every song Did my singing please you? No, the words you sang were wrong  Who is it whom I address? Who takes down what I confess? Are you the teachers of my heart? We teach old hearts to rest Oh teachers, are my lessons done?

        "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time INT. FARAH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT FARAH, a beautiful Indian Princess, lies asleep in bed. Translucent curtains billow in the breeze. PRINCE  Most people think time is like a river that flows swift and sure in one direction. But I have seen the face of Time, and I can tell you... they are wrong. Farah awakens suddenly with a gasp.  PRINCE  Time is an ocean in a storm.  EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT  The PRINCE runs through a dense jungle, pushing aside leaves and branches. Grim determination on his face, as if he is on his way to save the world. In fact, he is.  As he runs, we hear his VOICE OVER:  PRINCE  You may wonder who I am and why I say this. Sit down, and I will tell you a tale like none that you have ever heard.  THE JUNGLE SKY  A FLAMING ARROW arcs high into the air.  EXT. INDIAN PALACE --- DAWN KING SHAHRAMAN, 70, watches from an atoll on horseback. Beside him is the Prince. Below, an Indian Palace is under attack by Persian soldiers.  PRINCE  Know, first, that I am the son of Shahraman, a mighty king of Persia. On our way to Azad with a small company of men, we passed through India...  Swords and horsemen clash in the driving rain, Persian soldiers against Indian soldiers. Catapults hurl flaming projectiles. Part of the palace is on fire.  EXT. INSIDE PALACE GATES --- DAWN  A richly dressed Indian VIZIER, an obvious villain, sneaks up on the Indian Soldier guarding the main gate.  PRINCE  Where the promise of honor and glory tempted my father into a grievous error. The Vizier draws a dagger, kills the startled soldier, and pulls the rope to open the gate.  EXT. INDIAN PALACE --- DAWN  The gate goes up. With a cry of triumph, the Persian soldiers swarm toward the open gate.  SHAHRAMAN Now, my son!  Shahraman's old eyes gleam with the lifelong love of war. Letting out a battle cry, he gallops down the hill. The young Prince gallops eagerly after him.  EXT. INSIDE PALACE GATES --- DAWN Persian soldiers storm through the courtyard, overwhelming the surprised Indian soldiers.  Shahraman and the Prince gallop to a stop before the Vizier, who welcomes them. Fighting continues around them.  VIZIER  Your Majesty, the Maharajah's treasure vaults lie within.  He points. The Prince's eyes follow his pointing finger to a burning wing of the palace.  VIZIER I trust you will remember your promise...?  That's all the Prince needs to hear. He spurs his horse and gallops off in the direction indicated by the Vizier.  SHAHRAMAN  See how he rides! Like a warrior's son.  EXT. PALACE COURTYARD --- DAWN  The Prince, on horseback, charges through the palace gates. Fires burn around him. Soldiers fight hand-to-hand, on horseback and on foot.  Enthralled by the sights of battle at close range, the Prince fails to notice the burning column behind him start to topple.  His horse jumps out of the way, just in time to avoid being crushed by the falling column. The Prince is thrown. Jumps to his feet, too late to catch his fleeing horse. He is on foot, in the midst of battle. He reaches for his dagger --- realizes he's lost it: his thigh holster is empty. Game Play : Indian Palace A setting of great drama and chaos, with parts of the palace burning and collapsing, and hand-to-hand combat raging between Indian and Persian soldiers. A cannonball blasts a hole in the palace wall. Entering, the Prince finds himself in the Maharajah's treasure vault. The sounds of battle recede; the Prince is alone. In the center of the room is a giant HOURGLASS that seems to radiate a mysterious power. Bypassing the hourglass, the Prince scales a giant elephant statue to reach the DAGGER OF TIME.  INT. TREASURE VAULT - MORNING  A sensuous close-up view of the DAGGER OF TIME. The jewels in the hilt gleam. Its blade is translucent.  The Prince approaches the dagger, takes it. Turns it in his hand; he is curious to notice that it contains sand.  PRINCE Sand...  VIEW FROM ABOVE  High above the Prince, a massive stone gargoyle teeters...and starts to fall.  THE PRINCE  Unaware of the stone gargoyle plunging toward him, he notices a switch on the dagger's hilt. He presses it. SAND spills from the dagger onto the floor.  At the last second, the Prince looks up to see the gargoyle about to crush him. His eyes widen with the terror of certain death. But just then ---  REWIND!  The gargoyle springs back up, reversing its trajectory, and lands in its original position.  THE PRINCE  blinks, baffled as to what just happened.  As he is staring up at the gargoyle, it teeters, just as it did before, and starts to fall a second time.  This time, forewarned, the Prince jumps back out of the way. The gargoyle crashes harmlessly next to him.  He looks at the dagger. He still doesn't understand what happened --- but he's going to keep it. He sheathes the dagger in his empty thigh holster.  Just then, the walls start to shake around him. The treasure vault is about to collapse.  Game Play : Indian Palace, continued The Prince runs for his life as the palace collapses around him, finally landing back in the Hourglass Room.  INT. HOURGLASS ROOM --- MORNING  The Prince dives and lands on the floor, covering his head with his arms to protect himself from falling debris.  When no more debris falls, he dares to lift his head... and finds himself confronted by a pair of royal boots, inches from his nose.  Looking up, he sees King Shahraman glaring down at him in disapproval. A most undignified position for a Prince.  The Prince saves the moment by quickly rolling to his feet, and proudly displaying the dagger. PRINCE Father, I have brought us honor and glory!  The Vizier is seized by a tubercular coughing fit that makes both Shahraman and the Prince look at him.  VIZIER  Your Majesty... You promised me my choice of the Maharajah's treasures.  That dagger...  The Prince protects the dagger possessively. Shahraman looks indulgent; he has a soft spot for his youngest son.  SHAHRAMAN Surely you won't deny the lad a souvenir of his first battle? You may have your choice of all the Maharajah's other treasures.  Except that hourglass.  WHIP PAN TO THE HOURGLASS, now being lifted with ropes by six Persian soldiers.  SHAHRAMAN  ...That will make a fine gift for the Sultan of Azad, when we pass through his city.  The Vizier's expression transforms into a look of hate. SHAHRAMAN  And some exotic animals for his menagerie... and a few dozen slave girls... Yes, that should be enough. I shall choose them myself. BEHIND A COLUMN  While Shahraman's speech continues, Farah, the beautiful young Indian girl from the first scene, peers around the column. Her large dark eyes widen with outrage. SHAHRAMAN   I want no animals or maidens harmed  until I have chosen! Let it be known King Shahraman is merciful in victory! A shadow passes over Farah. She whirls with a gasp to see TWO PERSIAN SOLDIERS standing menacingly behind her. On her terror-stricken face ---  CUT TO:  EXT. PERSIAN DESERT --- DAY  A magnificent royal procession of hundreds of men, horses and animals, crosses the white sands.  PRINCE  'Trust not a man who has betrayed his master, nor take him into your own service... lest he betray you too.'  Illustrate this by panning from a caged tiger to the Indian Vizier riding alongside.  PRINCE  I learned the truth of this, to my sorrow, the day that we arrived in Azad as the Sultan's honored guests. The next carriage contains veiled SLAVE GIRLS. Peering out through the slatted window is Farah, her eyes burning with determination. Though she has been captured as a slave girl, we sense she is not resigned to her fate.  CAMERA lingers on Farah a moment... then RISES to reveal the caravan's destination: the splendid PALACE OF AZAD.  INT. RECEPTION HALL --- NIGHT  A splendid royal hall, lined with Persian men and women. Guards stand at attention. The roly-poly SULTAN OF AZAD steps down from his throne to greet King Shahraman .  SHAHRAMAN AND SULTAN  My friend!  They embrace.  SULTAN Your visit brings joy and honor to my poor and humble dwelling. If only you had given me time to prepare a proper welcome!  SHAHRAMAN  The glories of Azad are famed throughout the world. One cannot improve on perfection. And yet, I hope that in your palace there may still be room for a few paltry gifts from India.  Shahraman gestures. TWO DOZEN SLAVE GIRLS step forward in unison and bow to the Sultan with a flourish.  As CAMERA RACES down the row of slave girls, one of them surreptitiously lifts her eyes: Farah.  Shahraman gestures again. The Sultan's eyes glitter with childlike anticipation as he turns to see...  ROARR!!! The Sultan jumps as a BENGAL TIGER strains his leash held by two Persian Guards. Two more tigers behind. The Sultan shivers pleasurably.  SULTAN Magnificent specimens. And so many gifts! I am quite speechless!  SHAHRAMAN Ah, the best is yet to come! I give you... The Sands of Time!  He turns, gestures with a flourish to the Hourglass. The velvet cloth covering it flies up, lifted to the ceiling by a rope.  SHAHRAMAN May the friendship between our kingdoms endure as long as Time itself!  The Sultan approaches the Hourglass, studies it with fascination. The Slave Girls retreat to the far end of the hall.  SULTAN The Sand... Why does it glow?  SHAHRAMAN  Er, um...  VIZIER  I can tell you.  Shahraman and the Sultan turn in surprise; it is the Indian Vizier who has spoken. He takes this opportunity to step forward, with a dry cough.  VIZIER Inside the hourglass is a marvel that no living man has seen.  The Sultan's eyes light up --- only to be disappointed when the Vizier adds:  VIZIER Alas, I cannot open it. Only the Dagger can unlock the Sands of Time... and it belongs to a greater one than I.  He points suddenly to the Prince --- who is discomfited to find himself the center of attention.  VIZIER A young Prince dearer to his father than all the wealth of India. Perhaps he will oblige...?  Farah's eyes widen with horror as she sees ---  HER POV: FAST TRACK-IN, THE LENGTH OF THE HALL, TO CLOSE-UP OF THE DAGGER on the Prince's thigh.  FARAH No!  THE PRINCE,  happy to oblige, draws the dagger.  FARAH  rushes toward him. But there's a lot of distance to cover.  FARAH No! Stop!  THE PRINCE  Too far away to notice Farah, he steps to the hourglass, thrusts the dagger into the slot provided for that purpose, and twists it --- instantly triggering TIME-BLUR SLOW-MOTION EFFECT.  FARAH  running toward him, in slow motion...  FARAH NOOOOO!!!!  THE PRINCE  becomes aware of Farah's distorted cry. In slow motion, he turns, sees her running toward him...  As suddenly as it started, END TIME-BLUR SLOW-MOTION EFFECT.  Sand pours out of the hourglass onto the floor. The sand is bright white, almost glowing.  Farah stops running. It's too late.  Shahraman, the Sultan and Vizier stare at the flowing sand. The Vizier's eyes gleam with joyful expectation.  The room begins to shake.  Worried eyes rise to the vaulted ceiling as the shaking increases. Dust and bits of stone rain down.  The Sands of Time creep along the floor, slowly, like a dryice fog. The Prince looks down uneasily as the sand swirls around his feet, Shahraman's and the Vizier's.  The sand cloud rises around the Vizier. He takes a step back, raising his staff, and speaks imperious words of command in a foreign tongue:  VIZIER  'Sands of Time, Back!'  The ornament on the Vizier's staff FLASHES, repelling the sand cloud. Others in the room are not so lucky.  The Sultan shrinks uncomfortably from the sand cloud rising around him. Looks to Shahraman for reassurance.  SULTAN Is it meant to do this?  KING SHAHRAMAN  sees the Sands creeping up his legs. He tries to push it away, then draws his sword, trying to fight it. The sand  sucks the water from his body, transforming him into a hideous SANDMAN. A WOMAN SCREAMS.  PRINCE FATHER!!!  In quick succession, the Sultan and his two nearest BODYGUARDS are likewise transformed into Sandmen.  SCREAMING MEN AND WOMEN  run from the pursuing sands, as chunks of stone rain down from the ceiling. Farah among them.  THE PRINCE  looks down in confusion at himself. Why has he been spared? His Dagger is glowing, repelling the sand cloud, just as the Vizier's ornament did.  THE VIZIER  steps toward the Prince. Stretches out his hand.  VIZIER Give me the dagger!  PRINCE  No!!  VIZIER You have unleashed the Sands of Time. I can undo what you have done. Give it to me!  The Prince backs away in horror, shaking his head... Game Play : Royal Chambers As the Prince tries to escape, he is repeatedly attacked by hosts of Sandmen--the palace's inhabitants, transformed by Sands of Time into hideous monsters. The Dagger proves essential to his survival, since it is the only weapon that can vanquish them.  INT. PASSAGEWAY --- NIGHT  Farah grabs the Prince by the hand and yanks him into the passageway; the door slams shut behind them, sealing out a snarling Sandman. Farah faces the startled Prince. She puts her hand out.  FARAH Give me the Dagger.  The Prince stares at her for a moment. Sands of Time are swirling in the air around both of them; so why is she spared? Her MEDALLION is glowing, repelling the sand cloud. Like his dagger. Like the Vizier's staff.  The Prince pushes Farah against the wall. His eyes are wild and traumatized.  PRINCE Who are you?  FARAH I am Farah, the daughter of the Maharajah from whom you stole it. This is your doing.  PRINCE  I saw my father turned to sand!  FARAH And we will share his fate, if you do not give me the Dagger, to undo what you have done!  PRINCE Your traitorous Vizier used the same words.  From now on, I trust no one but myself. With a terrifying ROAR, TWO SANDMEN land nearby. Farah shrinks back in fear, as the Prince draws his sword.  PRINCE Run!  Farah doesn't need to be told twice. She scrambles through a crack in the wall. The Prince tries to follow, but is too big to fit. Giving up, he turns to face the Sandmen.  Farah's frightened eyes peer at him from the other side of the crack.  PRINCE Go back to the reception hall; wait for me there. GO!!!  And blocks a mighty blow as the Sandmen attack him. Game Play : Royal Chambers En route to the reception hall, the Prince helps a guard activate the palace's military defense system.  INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT  As the Prince throws his lever, the Guard simultaneously throws his. The DEFENSE MECHANISM rumbles to life.  SERIES OF QUICK CUTS showing traps activating in different locations throughout the palace:  QUICK CUT --- A PORTCULLIS  slams shut.  QUICK CUT --- SPIKES  spring out of the floor, skewering a Sandman, who explodes into a cloud of sand.  QUICK CUT --- ANOTHER PORTCULLIS  slams shut.  QUICK CUT --- BLADES  whip out of the wall, then retract, passing so close to the camera that it shakes.  INT. CONTROL ROOM --- NIGHT  The defense mechanism finishes its work, and comes to a stop. The Prince and Guard stand watching it. Game Play : Royal Chambers The Prince soon regrets having activated the defense system, as it makes his progress through the palace much more dangerous.  INT. RECEPTION HALL --- NIGHT  The Prince appears on a balcony overlooking the Reception Hall. He sees Farah surrounded by an army of menacing SAND PEOPLE.  PRINCE Farah!!  She looks up at him... then returns her attention to the desperate fight. Reloading her bow, she shoots arrow after arrow.  One SAND GUARD takes an arrow in the chest... and keeps on coming.  THE PRINCE  jumps off the balcony, does a spectacular walling and rebound to land between Farah and the Sand People. He draws his sword and dagger.  PRINCE Farah, get back!  Game Play : Reception Hall The Prince fights the sand creatures, with Farah's help, until only four are left.  INT. RECEPTION ROOM --- NIGHT  The Prince turns to face the new enemies.  THE FOUR ENEMIES  step forward. Three of them wear the uniforms of King Shahraman's personal bodyguards. The fourth wears the uniform of Shahraman himself.  He is THE SAND KING.  FARAH AND THE PRINCE  gasp in horror.  PRINCE FATHER!!  THE SAND KING  GROWLS... a hideous, inhuman sound. Though he resembles King Shahraman, he shows absolutely no recognition of his son. His face is as cold and dead as that of any sand creature. He steps forward to fight the Prince.  Game Play : Reception Hall The Prince fights and kills the Sand King.  INT. RECEPTION HALL --- NIGHT  The Prince and the Sand King SCREAM together in rage and pain as sand flows from the Sand King into the Prince`s dagger. And then it's over.  WIDE SHOT - HIGH ANGLE  The great hall, empty of enemies. The Prince falls to his knees and stays there.  Farah, at a distance, approaches him timidly.   THE PRINCE  On his knees, grieving.  Farah comes up behind him. Hesitant, awkward.  FARAH I'm sorry.  At first it seems the Prince has not heard her. Then, he speaks without turning. His voice is expressionless.  PRINCE Why?  FARAH  I know what it is to lose a father.  Now the Prince turns. His eyes are like ice.  PRINCE That was not my father.  He stands. Sheathes his sword and dagger.  He turns. Sees the VORTEX that has formed behind them.  His eyes narrow in determination. He strides toward the vortex. Farah is terrified. To her it looks like he's about to commit suicide.  FARAH What are you doing?... Wait! STOP!!  Ignoring her, the Prince PLUNGES into the Vortex. He lets out a cry of pleasure and pain as huge quantities of sand flow into his dagger from all sides.  WHAM!! The Prince finds himself levitated a meter off the floor, in fetal position. Farah stares in astonishment.  EXT. PALACE --- DAY   Establishing shot of the palace. Camera zeroes in on the TOWER OF DAWN, flies toward it at increasing speed, and into a window...  INT. TREASURE VAULT --- DAY   The SAND GRIFFIN's great wings flap slowly as it lowers the Hourglass into the center of the room. The Vizier stands nearby, supervising this operation.  EXT. TOWER OF DAWN --- DAY   The Sand Griffin flies out the window and glides down in spirals toward earth.  END VISION.  INT. RECEPTION HALL --- NIGHT  The Prince, curled up in fetal position on the cold marble floor, awakens. A shadow passes over him. He looks up...  And snatches the Dagger from the floor where it fell, moments before Farah is able to grab it. The Prince rolls to his feet. Farah is caught red-handed.  PRINCE So! This is the thanks I get for saving your life!  FARAH You don't understand! I need that Dagger, to undo ---  PRINCE 'To undo what I have done.' Truly, you must think I am a fool!  FARAH You are right to be cautious. But fight as bravely as you may, you cannot defeat this enemy. The Sands will spread. They will consume... everything. She lays her hand on his arm. Her big, dark eyes look straight into his. The Prince weakens.  FARAH I have heard it said that you are kind as well as brave. Please believe me. Help me find the Hourglass.  PRINCE  It is in the Sultan's treasure vault atop the Tower of Dawn.  FARAH How do you know that?  PRINCE I just know. Come with me, then, if you insist. But I warn you, I move pretty fast. You'd better keep up.  Farah is already running off. She climbs out the broken window and drops from sight.  EXT. PALACE --- NIGHT  Farah runs and jumps along the rocks, quick and agile.  Behind Farah, the Prince emerges from the hole in the palace wall. Farah turns, beckons for the Prince to follow.  FARAH Come on! Game Play : Zoo / Barracks Together, the Prince and Farah make their way through the moonlit ruins of the Sultan's fabled zoo. In the darkness prowl Sand Tigers and other frightening beasts, whom the Prince must fight. Escaping from the zoo, they pass through the military barracks, and emerge onto a bridge. EXT. BRIDGE --- NIGHT  A concrete bridge extends between two towers, a garden far below. Farah and the Prince appear at one end.  PRINCE This way!  CAMERA does a 180deg, showing a portcullis open at the other end of the bridge. The Prince runs INTO SHOT, across the bridge, Farah right behind him.  FARAH  A shadow passes over her. She stops. Looks up ---  FARAH  Look out!!  Warned, the Prince turns; dives out of the way just in time to avoid being clipped by the Sand Griffin's wing. The blow SHATTERS the bridge between them, creating an 8m gap. Farah scrambles to safety on her side of the gap. The Prince rolls to his feet and draws his sword, as the Sand Griffin circles and flies back toward him... Game Play : Broken Bridge The Prince fights off the Sand Griffin, and is again rewarded with a vision. INT. CISTERNS --- NIGHT   DESCENDING into a water chute...  MOVING through cavern passageways...  DRIFTING across the surface of a vast water tank...  SAND EUNUCHS AND COURTESANS, a terrifying vision, turn in unison to face us...  EXT. BROKEN BRIDGE --- NIGHT  Farah comes into focus on the other side of the bridge. Her voice seems to come from a great distance.  FARAH Wake up! Please wake up!  The Prince, lying on the ground, stirs. Gets up.  FARAH  Your arm!  The Prince looks at his left arm --- it's bare and bleeding, the sleeve partially torn off by the Sand Griffin's claws. He tears off the sleeve and tosses it away. He extends one arm to Farah.  PRINCE Farah, jump!  Their eyes meet. Farah trusts him. She jumps.  At the last moment, the Prince catches her by the arm. Farah hangs struggling in space...  WIDE SHOT  showing the two small figures hanging precariously from the broken bridge. Vertigo!  FARAH AND PRINCE  The Prince pulls Farah up to safety.  As he does, their faces are brought close together. For a moment it seems the Prince might kiss her... or say something nice... A MECHANICAL NOISE behind them. The Prince turns to see the portcullis starting to close.  Game Play : Broken Bridge The Prince and Farah sprint along the bridge toward the closing gate.  EXT. BROKEN BRIDGE --- NIGHT  Farah reaches the slowly descending portcullis first; ducks under it. Turning, she shouts to the Prince, who is still running:  FARAH I'll raise the gate for you!  She steps to the wall; grabs a lever ---  The Prince guesses what's about to happen. Sprinting toward the gate, he shouts ---  PRINCE NO!!  Too late. Farah throws the lever. Instantly, the gate SLAMS SHUT in the Prince's face just as he reaches it.  Farah throws the lever again. It does nothing. The Prince glares at her through the bars.  PRINCE You go on down. I'll find another way in.  Farah gives him a look of humiliation... then turns and runs off into the tower, until she has disappeared from sight. Game Play : Ext. Tower / Int. Baths With some difficulty, the Prince rejoins Farah in the royal baths just in time to save her from a bevy of Sand Eunuchs and Sand Courtesans.  INT. HAREM --- MORNING  A BLUR gradually comes into focus, becomes Farah  stroking the Prince's hair. He is lying on the tiled floor with his head in her lap.  FARAH  Don't leave me... My love... Please don't leave me.  The Prince's eyes flicker open.  PRINCE What did you call me?  Embarassed at having revealed her feelings, Farah briskly jumps to her feet, allowing the Prince's head to bang against the tiled floor.  FARAH It doesn't matter. The important thing is, I know how we can reach the Tower of Dawn.  PRINCE  Of course. The hourglass.  FARAH You said it was in the Sultan's treasure vault atop the tower. I hope you're right. It takes two to lower the bridge. One at the top of each watchtower.  PRINCE How do you know?  Farah's big brown eyes gaze innocently into his.  FARAH 'I just know.'  The Prince is uncertain whether she is making fun of him.  PRINCE All right. But this time, stay with me, and pay attention. I can't spend all day chasing after you.  Farah looks like she wants to make an angry retort. But the Prince is already moving on. Game Play : Hall of Learning / Barracks Farah and the Prince solve the mirror puzzle of the Hall of Learning, and escape onto the ramparts that connect the two watchtowers. The Prince sees Farah safely into her watchtower. He himself is not so lucky.  EXT. RAMPARTS --- DAY  As the Prince runs, the stone floor starts to crumble beneath his feet.  He turns, runs back. Too late. Falling, he tries to grab the crumbling ledge. It breaks away.  He plunges into the darkness of a stone shaft. A rain of rocks accompanies him. Falling past a ledge, he tries to grab it; his fingers slide off.  INT. DUNGEON --- DAY  WHAM! The Prince hits the stone floor. As he is getting up, a ROCK falls on his back, knocking him flat.  FADE TO BLACK.  FADE IN:  The Prince opens his eyes. He is in a dungeon, amid debris. Daylight streams in through a small barred window. And through the hole in the ceiling, high above.  Painfully, the Prince sits up. Rubs his head. He winces as he rises to his feet.  Grimly, he strips off his other torn sleeve; tosses it aside. Game Play : Prison / Forge / Barracks The Prince escapes from the dungeon, and uses a catapult to smash his way into the watchtower. As he throws his lever, Farah, in the other watchtower, throws hers... lowering the bridge to the Tower of Dawn.  EXT. TOWER OF DAWN --- DAY  As Farah and the Prince run across the bridge...  WHAM!!! The bridge shakes as the Sand Griffin lands, barring their way.  Farah backs away, drawing her bow. The Prince draws his sword to fight. The Sand Griffin bats him with a powerful wing, sending him flying back into the courtyard.  EXT. COURTYARD --- DAY The Prince lands, stunned. WHAM! The Sand Griffin lands in front of him.  The Prince gets warily to his feet. It's going to be a fight, and one he really isn't looking forward to.  FARAH Be careful! Game Play : Tower of Dawn Courtyard The Prince defeats the Sand Griffin and is again rewarded with a vision.  EXT. TOWER OF DAWN --- DAY  The Prince trembles as huge quantities of sand flow into the dagger from all sides. The dagger glows with a bright light.  INT. TOMB --- NIGHT   Farah looms into view, cold determination in her eyes. She reaches toward CAMERA...  THE DAGGER  lies beside a heap of the Prince's clothes, sword and sandals. Farah reaches for it...  EXT. TOWER OF DAWN --- DAY  The Prince awakens to find his head in Farah's lap; she is tenderly stroking his hair. In a flash he draws his dagger, scrambling to his feet. He faces her like an enemy. His eyes are wild with paranoia.  FARAH It's all right! It's me!  Confused, the Prince looks at the dagger in his hand. If she wanted to take it, she could have.  FARAH  It's me!  The Prince hesitates... then pockets the dagger. Farah takes his hand, guides him toward the open gate of the next room.  FARAH Look! At last we're here! The Tower of Dawn! Eagerly, she runs past him toward the open door. The Prince looks after her suspiciously. His visions have never lied to him before... Game Play : Tower of Dawn The Prince and Farah reach the treasure vault at the top of the Tower of Dawn, where the Vizier has brought the Hourglass.  INT. HOURGLASS VAULT --- DAY  The Prince lands on top of the hourglass. Farah, excited, calls to him from below.  FARAH You did it! Do you see the dome atop the hourglass?  The Prince looks. Sees the bubble of a glass dome just as she described it.  FARAH Take the dagger. Strike it into the center of the dome!  The Prince draws his dagger, ready to obey. He looks at Farah ---  QUICK CUT --- VISION FLASHBACK  Farah looms into view, cold determination in her eyes, reaching toward camera...  BACK TO SCENE  The Prince looks at the dagger in his hand. Looks down at Farah; she is standing below, looking up at him.  PRINCE  Why does the Vizier want the dagger?  FARAH What? Go on --- do it!  The Prince hesitates. He lowers the dagger.  PRINCE You have every reason to hate me.  FARAH What are you talking about?  PRINCE My father's army sacked your palace... captured you as a slave. Now you want me to trust you.  FARAH  Please. There's no time!  The Prince turns. Farah turns. CAMERA WHIPS following their gaze to ---  THE VIZIER  stands in the entrance to the Hourglass Room. His eyes blaze. He raises his staff, a terrifying sorcerer.  VIZIER  'Winds of the desert, blow! Blow! Blow!!'  Even as he speaks, WIND stirs the room...  THE PRINCE  atop the hourglass, is suddenly BLOWN across the room. Hits the wall, sprawls on the floor under a window. He's missed his chance.  FARAH  NOOOO!!!!  THE VIZIER  His staff ornament GLOWS, a nimbus of wizardly light protecting him from the howling winds and blowing SAND. He advances on the Prince. Stretches out his hand.  VIZIER Give me the dagger!  FARAH  grabs hold of a pillar, clings to it desperately. But the wind is too strong; it breaks her grip. With a cry, she sails across the room.  The Prince lunges, grabs her hand just in time to save her from being blown out the window. With his other hand, he grasps a pillar.  FARAH  The dagger! He must not get the dagger!  The Vizier advances determinedly. As he reaches out for his prize, the Prince suddenly lets go of the pillar. The surprised Vizier's hand closes on empty air, as the Prince and Farah fly out the window. Game Play : Sandstorm Blown across the parapets by the howling sandstorm, the Prince and Farah manage to find shelter.  INT. TOMB --- DAY   The door SHUTS behind the Prince and Farah, sealing out the howling winds. TORCHES flame on, illuminating a mausoleum.  The Prince's gaze flies to the stone slab in the center of the room. His eyes widen in superstious fear.  PRINCE A tomb! Farah whirls to face the Prince in bewildered anger. All is lost now --- and it's his fault.  FARAH You were there! The dagger was in your hand! Why did you hesitate?  The Prince has no reply. He knows he screwed up.  FARAH You think you're cleverer than everybody. But you're just like the rest of them... those soldiers... All they can do is fight, destroy. Why did I trust you?!?  The Prince slumps down onto the tomb, head in hands. His despair is obvious.  Farah sees his distress. Her eyes fill. She sits beside him, places her hand tenderly on his shoulder.  FARAH  Why didn't you trust me? The Prince looks up at her.  Farah looks back at him as if she wants to be kissed. She has never been more beautiful.  As if in a dream, the Prince leans toward her...  THE TORCHES GO OUT. TOTAL BLACKNESS. Scuffling sounds.  FARAH Ow!  PRINCE Sorry.  More scuffling sounds.  FARAH  Where are you?!  PRINCE I'm right here.  FARAH Hold my hand. Don't let go.  Silence. Nestling sounds. Breathing.  FARAH I didn't mean what I said.  PRINCE  No, you're right. All that's happened is my doing. I wanted honor and glory... I brought this on us.  In the darkness Farah puts her arms around him, holds him.  FARAH You are brave and good. If this tomb is to be ours... at least the Dagger will be buried with us. And... we are together.  In the silence...  FARAH What is it?  PRINCE Nothing.  FARAH You're trembling!  PRINCE  I just don't like close spaces. There must be some way out of here.  Silence.  FARAH When I was small, my mother taught me a secret word. She said that when I was afraid, all I had to do was speak that word and a magic door would open.  I've never told that to anybody.  PRINCE I can see why. It's the most childish thing I've ever heard of.  What was the word? FARAH  'Kakolookiyam.'  As she says the words, there is a noise like stone sliding against stone. More scuffling sounds.  PRINCE  You did that. Didn't you?  No reply.  PRINCE  Farah?  The TORCHES ILLUMINATE again, revealing the room. The Prince is alone. The slab has been moved. Game Play : Magic Cavern In a dreamlike sequence, the Prince descends a flight of stairs into the tomb, and finds Farah in a place that is not quite real.  INT. MAGIC CAVERN Farah is already in the room, staring with delight at something off-camera. As the Prince comes up beside her, she takes his hand.  FARAH It's beautiful.  They both stand there staring at the same incredible sight. Farah grins suddenly with childlike delight. She runs offscreen. We HEAR A SPLASH.  FARAH IN THE POOL  Farah surfaces in a tiled pool, from which steam rises invitingly.  FARAH Come on!  THE PRINCE  advances in disbelief, taking in their surroundings.  A table with a jug of wine and fresh fruit. A luxurious bed with silk pillows and draperies. Hundreds of lit candles illuminate a room fit for a prince and princess's honeymoon.  The Prince descends the tiled steps into the pool. As he approaches, Farah swims backward, treading water. A slight teasing smile on her lips.  As the Prince exits frame, HOLD on the empty wall. The flickering candlelight casts SILHOUETTES of Farah and the Prince on the wall.  SILHOUETTES ON THE WALL  The Prince advances, waist-high in the water. Farah treads water with only her head visible.  Then Farah stands. Faces the Prince. Takes off whatever she's wearing. We only see their shadows.  PRINCE  Kakolookiyam.  The shadows embrace, kiss.  FADE OUT.  INT. TOMB --- DAY   The Prince awakens with a start, as if from a dream. As he looks around the room, his eyes fall on ---  His clothing and sandals, in a heap on the floor. No dagger. And no sword.  It was no dream. Game Play : Tomb In the cold light of morning, the tomb is just a plain mausoleum, with no magic stairway. Farah is gone. The Prince finds the way out. EXT. SAND DRIFT --- DAY  The Prince climbs out of a sand drift; shakes off sand. He stands there blinking incredulously into the bright daylight.  WHAT HE SEES  PANORAMIC VIEW of the entire palace buried in sand. Only the highest minarets, including the upper part of the Tower of Dawn, are visible. The rest is buried.  THE PRINCE  The SHRIEK of a Sand Bird attracts his attention. He looks up to see Farah climbing the Tower of Dawn with grim determination. She holds the Prince's dagger in one hand, his old sword --- too heavy for her --- in the other.  PRINCE Farah! No!  She glances back over her shoulder --- then climbs on, ignoring him. SAND BIRDS circle her like vultures. Game Play : Tower of Dawn Beset by Sand Birds, the Prince climbs the tower after Farah, and finds a magic sword to replace the one she stole. Though handicapped by not having the dagger, he manages to reach the top of the tower... EXT. TOWER OF DAWN ROOFTOP - DAY  Farah faces the Sand Giffin.  The Dagger in one hand, she awkwardly swings the heavy sword with the other. The Griffin SNARLS; lunges at her. Farah holds it off.  THE PRINCE  reaches the top and is horrified by the sight.  PRINCE FARAH!!  Farah turns at the sound of his voice. The Griffin strikes her a mighty blow with its claw, knocking the sword from her hand and smashing a hole in the roof.  The roof caves in beneath Farah's feet. As she falls, she manages to grab the edge of the hole. She still has the Dagger.  The Prince runs toward her...  Farah desperately tries to climb back up to safety...  Just as the Prince reaches Farah, a large chunk of roof breaks off and she falls. The Prince lunges and grabs the dagger in her hand --- by the blade.  The Prince grimaces with determination. His grip tightens on the blade; he is bearing Farah's entire weight. That's got to hurt.  A thin line of blood trickles from his fist. A drop lands on Farah's cheek.  She looks at him. In her eyes we see love, understanding... and, finally, peace.  FARAH  Kakolookiyam.  PRINCE Farah, no!  She lets go of the dagger. And falls.  The Prince scrambles to the edge of the hole. Looks down. His expression is pure horror.  WHAT HE SEES: Farah lying dead at the bottom of the hole, far below in the Hourglass Room. A drop of blood on her cheek.  THE SAND GRIFFIN  strikes the Prince from behind, sending him sprawling. With a snarl, the monster advances on him.  The Prince's expression transforms to grim determination. Drawing his sword, he rises to his feet to face the Sand Griffin. This is going to be the fight of his life.  Game Play : Tower of Dawn The Prince defeats the Sand Griffin for the last time, and descends into the Hourglass Room...  INT. HOURGLASS ROOM --- DAY  Farah lies motionless amid the debris of the fallen rooftop. The Prince rushes to her side, lifts her in his arms. She is dead.  PRINCE No. No.  Lost in grief, the Prince fails to notice the shadow passing over him, as the Vizier steals up on him from behind...  The Prince whirls with lightning speed. Before the Vizier can strike, the Prince snatches his staff and flings it away. In an instant the Vizier is flat on his back, the Prince crouched over him like a tiger, eyes blazing, dagger raised to kill.  VIZIER  The girl... is unimportant. Give me the dagger... and I will give you power such as no king since  Suleyman has dreamed of. Eternal Life... will be yours.  The Prince's eyes narrow with hatred.  PRINCE Live forever... when those I loved are dead, and I to blame! I choose Death.  The Vizier gleams with anticipation, fully expecting the Prince to strike the dagger into his heart. Oddly, this prospect seems to fill the Vizier not with fear, but exaltation. But before we can wonder why...  Instead of striking the fatal blow, the Prince vaults off the Vizier and runs up the wall, from which he executes a brilliant rebound, landing on top of the hourglass.  Standing atop the hourglass, the Prince raises the dagger high, blazing with determination.  The Vizier realizes what's about to happen. His eyes go wide with terror ---  VIZIER NO!!!!!!  The Prince PLUNGES the dagger into the center of the sun. A BLINDING BURST OF LIGHT. Like a nuclear blast.  THE BIGGEST REWIND OF ALL.  PRINCE  Bravely I had fought, and slain my enemies. Honor and glory were mine. But though I fight until the desert sands themselves were red with blood... I could not bring back the dead. It starts out slow: the dagger comes up out of the hourglass, the Prince reverses his jump and walling move...  ...then faster: Farah rises up out of the caved-in roof, which reassembles...  ...Faster and faster, a jumble of fragmented images from the game, hours now compressed into seconds...  ...at last slowing again to viewable speed, as the Prince gallops backwards through a battle between Indian and Persian soldiers...  INT. FARAH'S BEDROOM --- NIGHT  Farah awakens in bed with a gasp.  INT. TENT --- NIGHT  At the same instant, the Prince is likewise startled awake.  Clutched in his hand is the Dagger. He looks at it as if seeing it for the first time. Then looks around, getting his bearings. He is in a small tent. NIGHT SOUNDS.  EXT. MILITARY ENCAMPMENT --- NIGHT  The Prince emerges from his tent and looks around.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL that his tent is one of a hundred like it. The Persian Army is camped on an Indian plain. We see horses tied up, a few Persian soldiers on guard. The rest of the army is asleep in their tents.  Hearing voices, the Prince sneaks up on a larger tent nearby, and eavesdrops. We SEE SHADOWS of Shahraman and a Soldier inside.  SOLDIER  ...And at dawn, we march.  SHAHRAMAN  A great deal depends upon this traitor. If he should fail?  SOLDIER  Your Majesty, he will signal with a flaming arrow shot into the air. When we see it, we attack. And not before.  The Prince backs away from the tent... turns, and runs off into the night.  EXT. JUNGLE --- NIGHT  The PRINCE runs through a dense jungle, pushing aside branches. Grim determination is on his face, as if he is on his way to save the world. In fact, he is.  The Prince reaches the edge of the jungle, and pauses, pushing aside leaves...  WHAT HE SEES  The Maharajah's palace compound, lying just beyond the edge of the jungle.  INT. FARAH'S BEDROOM --- NIGHT  Farah, awakened, gets out of bed in her nightgown. Pushing aside the translucent curtains, she walks to the edge of her balcony and looks out. NIGHT SOUNDS.  WHAT SHE SEES  The edge of the jungle .  FARAH  Hearing a sound, she whirls suddenly with a frightened gasp to see the Prince standing on her balcony.  PRINCE Do not be afraid.  Farah shrinks back as the Prince advances on her. She is very much afraid --- but her expression suggests that if he attacks her, she'll fight back anyway.  Her eyes widen in fear as the Prince draws a dagger. To her surprise, instead of attacking, he offers it to her, handle first.  PRINCE This belongs to you.  Farah looks at the dagger. To her confusion, she recognizes it. Her hand flies unconsciously to touch the medallion at her throat, an instinctive gesture.  FARAH The Dagger of Time! But it is locked away within my father's treasure vault! How ---  PRINCE Most people think time is like a river that flows swift and sure in one direction. But I have seen the face of Time, and I can tell you... they are wrong. Time is an ocean in a storm.  Farah looks at him with the first sign of interest.  PRINCE  You may wonder who I am and why I say this. Sit down, and I will tell you a tale like none that you have ever heard.  Farah sits down on a pillow. On her listening face, DISSOLVE TO...  EXT. MAHARAJAH'S PALACE --- DAWN  As the Prince's talking voice fades out, we HEAR PRINCE'S VOICE-OVER, as we have heard it throughout the game:  PRINCE  ...And that is why I have come. To warn you and your father to arrest this treacherous Vizier before he betrays you, and brings ruin on us all.  INT. FARAH'S BEDROOM --- DAWN  Farah sits listening to the Prince finish his story, which has taken him all night to tell.  PRINCE His signal is a flaming arrow shot into the air. Prevent him, and my father's army will know the traitor has been unmasked. They will turn back.  His voice and expression plead with her to believe him. Farah still seems undecided... Then, a DRY COUGH from the shadows makes them both turn.  VIZIER A wild tale, indeed. I have a simpler version.  The Vizier steps out of the shadows.  VIZIER A Persian soldier, lusting for glory, entered the chambers of the Maharajah's daughter and was slain --- by me.  Magic staff in hand, the Vizier advances menacingly toward the Prince. The Prince scowls. Draws his sword.  Game Play : Farah's Bedroom The Vizier attacks the Prince using magic. The Prince defends himself with a sword. The battle ends outside on the balcony.  EXT. EDGE OF JUNGLE --- DAWN  The Vizier staggers, mortally wounded. With a baffled expression on his face, he crumples to his knees.  VIZIER I could have been... immortal.  And he falls. The Prince stands there, sword in hand, a weary warrior. He turns to see Farah staring in wonderment.  FARAH Then it's true. He was a traitor.  PRINCE  Take this. Return it to your father's treasure vault. Guard it well.  Farah does not reach for it.  FARAH  I owe you thanks. But why did you invent such a fantastic story? Do you think me a child, that I would believe such nonsense?  Frustrated, the Prince grabs Farah in his arms and gives her a passionate kiss. She struggles against him, finally escapes with a violent shove.  FARAH  I said I owe you thanks. You presume too much.  The Prince looks resigned. Before Farah's eyes, he lifts the dagger... and PRESSES THE REWIND SWITCH.  FAST REWIND, reversing the kiss, and stopping on ---  FARAH  ...such a fantastic story? Do you think me a child, that I would believe such nonsense?  The Prince sighs: he'll never convince her. In his eyes is a new maturity, tinged with gentle regret. He places the dagger into her hands.  PRINCE You're right. It was just a story.  Farah looks relieved. The Prince turns to head back into the jungle. As he climbs up onto a giant fallen tree --  FARAH Wait!  I don't even know your name.  The Prince hesitates. Then inspiration strikes.  PRINCE Just call me... Kakolookiyam!  With a wink, he jumps down, and vanishes into the jungle.  FARAH  wonders: How could he possibly have known that?  She wrestles with it. Giving up, she turns away... Looks down at the dagger in her hands... Then looks back. A doubt in her eyes.  As she debates, we PULL BACK until Farah is just a small figure standing at the edge of the clearing... Behind her, the safety of the palace; before her, the vast impenetrable darkness of the jungle.  ROLL END CREDITS.6",

        "Celebration Of The Lizard Lions in the street and roaming Dogs in heat, rabid, foaming A beast caged in the heart of a city The body of his mother Rotting in the summer ground He fled the town He went down South and crossed the border Left chaos and disorder Back there over his shoulder One morning he awoke in a green hotel With a strange creature groaning beside him Sweat oozed from its shining skin Is everybody in? Is everybody in? Is everybody in? The ceremony is about to begin Wake up! You can't remember where it was Had this dream stopped? The snake was pale gold, glazed and shrunken We were afraid to touch it The sheets were hot dead prisms And she was beside me Old, she's no, young Her dark red hair, the white soft skin Now, run to the mirror in the bathroom Look! she's coming in here I can't live through each slow century of her moving I let my cheek slide down, the cool smooth tile Feel the good cold stinging blood The smooth hissing snakes of rain Once I had a little game I liked to crawl back in my brain I think you know, the game I mean I mean the game, called, 'Go insane' You should try this little game Just close your eyes forget your name Forget the world, forget the people And we'll erect, a different steeple This little game is fun to do Just close your eyes, no way to lose And I'm right there, I'm going too Release control, we're breaking through Way back deep into the brain Back where there's never any pain And the rain falls gently on the town And over the heads of all of us And in the labyrinth of streams Beneath, the quiet unearthly presence of Gentle hill dwellers, in the gentle hills around Reptiles abounding Fossils, caves, cool air heights Each house repeats a mold, windows rolled Beast car locked in against morning All now sleeping Rugs silent, mirrors vacant Dust Lying under the beds of lawful couples Wound in sheets And daughters, smug With semen eyes in their nipples Wait There's been a slaughter here Don't stop to speak or look around Your gloves and fan are on the ground We're getting out of town, we're going on the run And you're the one I want to come Not to touch the earth Not to see the sun Nothing left to do, but Run, run, run Let's run, let's run House upon the hill, moon is lying still Shadows of the trees Witnessing the wild breeze C'mon baby run with me Let's run Run with me Run with me Run with me Let's run The mansion is warm at the top of the hill Rich are the rooms and the comforts there Red are the arms of luxuriant chairs And you won't know a thing till you get inside Dead President's corpse in the driver's car The engine runs on glue and tar C'mon along, we're not going very far To the East to meet the Czar Run with me Run with me Run with me Let's run Some outlaws lived by the side of the lake The minister's daughter's in love with the snake Who lives in a well by the side of the road Wake up, girl!

        "I'm the Guy Who Found the Lost Chord I was sitting at my piano, the other day But my mind was ill at ease They were coming to take it away that afternoon I was all by myself in a mellow mood Improvising symphonies My right hand was playing Mozart's minuet And at the same time my left hand was playing; have a banana; from Carmen And at the same time my mouth was whistling a sextet from Luicini And at the same time What do you think my foot was doing? While keeping time it was cracking walnuts; see I had to eat too Then in the midst of all soliloquy I found it, I found it The Lost Chord, The Lost Chord! So let's celebrate I'm feeling great I'm the guy that found the Lost chord I'll have my name in the hall of fame; cos I went and found that lost chord  Everyone knows Tchaikovsky wasn't recognised for 300 years Brahms wasn't recognised for 400 years Beethoven wasn't recognised for 500 years But I can't wait that long I've only got two changes of clothes!  People said I was mad. but that didn't trouble me They said Mozart was mad They said Puccini was mad They said Louis was mad Who's Louis? My uncle, he was mad! So let's celebrate I'm feeling great I'm the guy that found the Lost chord  You know it wasn't easy finding that Lost chord Working in my attic I didn't sleep for days and days I'd be in terrible shape if I hadn't slept nights! First I put an A flat with a B minor Then I put a B minor with and F major Then I put and F minor with a B major Then I tried an A and a B and a B and a C And a C and a D and a D and E and an E and a F And a F and a G; What a piano no apostrophe's !  And this is what I came up with   What's happened that isn't the chord  Neither is that  Neither is that  And neither is that! I lost the chord a catatstrophe I'm gonna sit down on the keyboard of this piano until the chord is return    That's it the lost chord! I found it, I found by sitting on the piano keyboard Strange I usually play by ear! So let's celebrate I'm feeling great I'm the guy that found the Lost chord",

I exchange thoughts with the clouds I hold my breath Ahh, it's just hard shell you can't see Is that where the bottom is? The shadow burns me Ahh, I just want to keep forgetting Slip your desires into the ants' nest Come now, all you have to do now is be reborn again  Let tomorrow sleep and peacefulness will turn to you Free yourself and go with your razor sharp emotions Even the twisted flow is the proof that you are alive I invite the tearfully-indulging tomorrow  The inculcated Dogra Magra The pain of the mark and the one and only personality And those colorful eyes all decorated I don't want them anymore Is hypocrisy going to come and take it away? The lonely red stage at night I dedicate the following to the aspiring leading actor That's where the truth is  The small corner of my un-cheatable heart says I still want to be here Who can't we forgive? I let them hear my cold voice And i swear  I will live with my work I scream with this body of flesh that separates heaven and hell I carve the sins What will be the proof of my existence if it disappears with the wind?  I've stared at the strong shining moon long enough to be bored Can't even turn myself into a werewolf But just enough to become crazy by the darkness I want to suck the neck The emptiness of the remains I won't let you sleep At the age where you just want attention...tonight I might go crazy for you.  Everyone wants to reach out their hand and grab happiness But they just end up becoming the monster that lies deep in darkness The end has already come to life It will take form at zero and will crawl back into the uterus and rot Every time this happens your faces crumble  No one wants to talk about truth that hurts the ear The suppressed minds  Compensate the sins and let life be gone  The emptiness of the antithesis Becomes the choking and crying land Bury the bones in the common land immersed in thesis Be burdened by depression The gritty tsunami takes me away and I smile with bitter tears Couldn't understand the value of things The hanging of the necks at the 13 stairs Seeing people becoming friendly while clapping hands That mixes in with sissy thoughts and hurts others Seeing you like this it's just too sad  Splash of blood Squashing basic instincts Talk about death  I will live with my work I scream with this body of flesh that separates heaven and hell I carve the sins. What will be the proof of my existence if it disappears with the wind?  No one wants to talk about the truth that hurts the ear The suppressed minds  Compensate the sins, and let life be gone  Is it a sin for me to live because I am evil?",

There's no way to explain it But I swear as well as pain There should be joy but we sustain The same level of mundane And it's numbing me through I often wonder if I'd miss you And have the urge to kiss you If an issue was to hit through To this heart that now feels disused And said issue was too big to just ignore And I walked out on you  The chances are I'd fall apart And suffer seizures of the heart As my chest begins to smart The very second have to part I want to go back to the start But then again maybe I just feel new Maybe I'd get my life on track And start to focus my attack On all the things my life just lacks And start to claw my passion back Instead of living like a hack Half committed half relaxed I'd have nothing to lose  Chorus   I guess lately I've had too much time to think And yeah way too much drink When paper meets the ink Over-thinking is the chink in my armour That's just what I do And I've always been that way Forever questioning each day And every plea that's made That maybe when I lay My busy mind will make me prove By finding problems and reasons That might not even be true See we got together so young Before our real lives had begun But flowers don't grow up as one Each finds its own route to the sun And that's exactly what we've done We've grown up separately too And for a few years now it's been the problem And these realisations, I wish that I could stop them But I've realised that love is all we have in common And deep down you know that's true  But then surely that I'm still in love with you Means there's something we can do To get us through and to pursue A brand new point of view On how this gap grew, between me and you  So there's a weight over me and I'd hate to have to leave But in fate I don't believe and the state of you and me Isn't great as you can see So I'll keep thinking this through  Chorus 1",
