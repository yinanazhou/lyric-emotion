[Verse 3] What good am I while you softly weep And I hear in my head what you say in your sleep And I freeze in the moment like the rest who don't try What good am I?  [Verse 4] What good am I then to others and me If I've had every chance and yet still fail to see If my hands are tied must I not wonder within Who tied them and why and where must I have been?  [Verse 5] What good am I if I say foolish things And I laugh in the face of what sorrow brings And I just turn my back while you silently die What good am I?1Embed",

Warhorse LyricsPart 1: Recipe for Hate  [Verse 1] Each day, my shortcomings pick my pockets My faults were letters carved in stone As meaningful to you as words written in water I'm left to walk this world alone In a broken mold they made me The black sheep of the family Worth less than zero My opinion and room temperature IQ I did something, now I'm nothing Always wrong with this or that Poisoned with fear Watch it twist my measly brain mad  [Verse 2] Talk about me when my back is turned Next time we meet, it will be too late The memory burnt in my ears of what you said And now I've got a recipe for hate, taste it Dark clouds on the horizon make it hard to breathe A walking mistake But every time I run away I just come back for more The choice is clear I can quit and fall on my sword Or light a fire to see who runs or stays And plays the confidence game Part 2: Warhorse  [Verse 3] I'm feeling quite invisible I feel just like thin air The truth taunts me That nobody wants me I see the Earth below me I watch it spin there Does someone somewhere out there hear me? Sentenced to walk in purgatory My life is running down I can't believe what they've done to me I'm left riding a warhorse A man without a countryEmbed",

Well, life began to twist its way around him And I wondered how he carried such a load He came back again to try his luck in music And lost his wife and family on the road After that he seemed to bog down even deeper And I saw what booze and pills could really do And I wondered if I'd ever see him sober But I'd forgot about a friend that Leonard knew  Well, Leonard gave me lots of inspiration He helped teach me how to write a country song And he even brought around a bag of groceries Hey, back before Muskogee came along  Really I'm not trying to hide his show name Or the town in which this episode began Somehow I had to write a song for old Tommy If just to see the smiling faces in the band  Well, when Leonard finally came to California He was twenty-one years old, as I recall And he loved to write a song and pick the guitar And he came to hang a gold one on the wallEmbed",

Anyway, here we are, my eighth and final appearance at this unique event. And I am excited. If this material works well, I'm going to use it at Goldman Sachs next year. Earn me some serious Tubmans. That's right. That's right.  My brilliant and beautiful wife Michelle is here tonight. She looks so happy to be here. It's called practice. It's like learning to do three-minute planks. She makes it look easy now. But...  Next year at this time, someone else will be standing here in this very spot and it's anyone guess who she will be. But standing here I can't help but be reflective and a little sentimental.  Eight years ago I said it was time to change the tone of our politics. In hindsight, I clearly should have been more specific. Eight years ago, I was a young man full of idealism and vigor. And look at me now, I am gray, grizzled and just counting down the days to my death panel. Hillary once questioned whether I would be ready for a 3 a.m. phone call. Now, I'm awake anyway because I have to go to the bathroom. I'm up.  In fact somebody recently said to me, 'Mr. President, you are so yesterday. Justin Trudeau has completely replaced you. He is so handsome and he's so charming. He's the future.' And I said 'Justin, just give it a rest.' I resented that.  Meanwhile, Michelle has not aged a day. The only way you can date her in photos is by looking at me. Take a look. [Show photos over the years] Here we are in 2008. Here we are a few years later. And this one is from two weeks ago. [skeleton photo from Canada dinner] So time passes.  In just six short months, I will be officially a lame duck, which means Congress now will flat out reject my authority, and Republican leaders won't take my phone calls. And this is going to take some getting use to. It's really gonna... It's a curve ball. I don't know what to do with it. Of course, in fact, for four months now congressional Republicans have been saying there are things I cannot do in my final year. Unfortunately, this dinner was not one of them.  But on everything else, it's another story. And you know who you are, Republicans. In fact, I think we've got Republican senators Tim Scott and Cory Gardner. They are in the house, which reminds me ... security bar the doors. Judge Merrick Garland come on out. We are going to do this right here. Right now. It's like the Red Wedding.  But it's not just Congress. Even some foreign leaders, they've been looking ahead, anticipating my departure. Last week, Prince George showed up to our meeting in his bathrobe. That was a slap in the face. A clear breach of protocol.  Although, while in England I did have lunch with Her Majesty the Queen, took in a performance of Shakespeare, hit the links with David Cameron. Just in case anybody is still debating whether I am black enough, I think that settles the debate.  I won't lie, look, this is a tough transition. It's hard. Key staff are now starting to leave the White House. Even reporters have left me. Savannah Guthrie, she has left the White House press corps to host the Today show. Norah O'Donnell left the briefing room to host CBS This Morning. Jake Tapper left journalism to join CNN.  But the prospect of leaving the White House is a mixed bag. You might have heard that someone jumped the White House fence last week, but I have to give the Secret Service credit. They found Michelle and brought her back. She's safe back at home now. It's only nine more months, baby. Settle down. And yet somehow, despite all this, despite the churn, in my final year my approval ratings keep going up. The last time I was this high, I was trying to decide on my major. And here's the thing, I haven't really done anything differently. So it's odd. Even my age can't explain the rising poll numbers. What has changed nobody can figure it out. [Image of Cruz and Trump]. Puzzling.  Anyway. In this last year, I do have more appreciation for those who have been with me on this amazing ride. Like one of our finest public servants, Joe Biden. God bless him. I love that guy. I love Joe Biden. I really do. And I want to thank him for his friendship, for his counsel, for always giving it to me straight, for not shooting anybody in the face. Thank you, Joe.  Also, I would be remiss. Let's give it up for our host, Larry Wilmore. Also known as one of the two black guys who's not Jon Stewart. You're the South African guy, right? I love Larry. And his parents are here, who are from Evanston, which is a great town. I also would like to acknowledge some of the award-winning reporters that we have with us here tonight. Rachel McAdams, Mark Ruffalo, Liev Schreiber. Thank you all for everything you have done. I'm just joking. As you know, Spotlight is a film, a movie about investigative journalists with the resources and the autonomy to chase down the truth and hold the powerful accountable. Best fantasy film since Star Wars.  Look. That was maybe a cheap shot. I understand the news business is tough these days. It keeps changing all the time. Every year at this dinner somebody makes a joke about Buzzfeed, for example, changing the media landscape. And every year The Washington Post laughs a little bit less hard. Kind of a silence there. Especially at the Washington Post table.  GOP chairman Reince Priebus is here as well. Glad to see that you feel you have earned a night off. Congratulations on all your success, the Republican party, the nomination process. It's all going great. Keep it up. Kendall Jenner is also here. And we had a chance to meet her backstage. She seems like a very nice, young woman. I'm not exactly sure what she does, but I'm told that my twitter mentions are about to go through the roof.  Helen Mirren is here tonight. I don't even have a joke here, I just think Helen Mirren is awesome. She's awesome. Sitting at the same table I see Mike Bloomberg. Mike, a combative, controversial New York billionaire is leading the GOP primary, and it is not you. That has to sting a little bit. Although it's not an entirely fair comparison between you and the Donald. After all Mike was a big city mayor. He knows policy in depth. And he's actually worth the amount of money that he says he is.  What an election season. For example, we've got the bright new face of the Democratic party here tonight, Mr. Bernie Sanders. There he is, Bernie. Bernie, you look like a million bucks. Or, to put in terms you'll understand, you look like 37,000 donations of $27 each.  A lot of folks have been surprised by the Bernie phenomenon, especially his appeal to young people. But not me. I get it. Just recently a young person came up to me and said she was sick of politicians standing in the way of her dreams. As if we were actually going to let Malia go to Burning Man this year. Was not going to happen. Bernie might have let her go. Not us.  I am hurt though, Bernie, that you have been distancing yourself a little from me. I mean that's just not something that you do to your comrade.  Bernie's slogan has helped his campaign catch fire among young people. 'Feel the Bern.' 'Feel the Bern.' That's a good slogan. Hillary's slogan has not had the same effect. Let's see this. [image of a boulder on a hill with the slogan \"Trudge up the Hill\"]  Look, I've said how much I admire Hillary's toughness, her smarts, her policy chops, her experience. You've got admit it though, Hillary trying appeal to young voters is a little bit like your relative who just signed up for Facebook. 'Dear America, did you get my poke? Is it appearing on your wall? I'm not sure I'm using this right. Love, Aunt Hillary.' It's not entirely persuasive.  Meanwhile, on the Republican side, things are a little more, how shall we say this, a little more loose. Just look at the confusion over the invitations to tonight's dinner. Guests were asked to check whether they wanted steak or fish. But instead, a whole bunch of you wrote in Paul Ryan. That's not an option, people. Steak or fish. You may not like steak or fish, but that's your choice.  Meanwhile, some candidates aren't polling high enough to qualify for their own joke tonight. [image of Kasich eating]. The rules were well established ahead of time.  And then there's Ted Cruz. Ted had a tough week. He went to Indiana. Hoosier country. Stood on a basketball court and called the hoop a basketball ring. What else is in his lexicon? Baseball sticks? Football hats? But sure, I'm the foreign one.  Well let me conclude tonight on a more serious note. I want thank the Washington press corps. I want to thank Carol for all that you do. The free press is central to our democracy and, nah, I'm just kidding! You know I'm going to talk about Trump! Come on. We weren't just going to stop there. Come on.  Although I am a little hurt that he's not here tonight. We had so much fun that last time, And it is surprising. You've got a room full of reporters, celebrities, cameras. And he says no. Is this dinner too tacky for the Donald? What could he possibly be doing instead? Is he at home eating a Trump steak, tweeting out insults to Angela Merkel? What's he doin'?  The Republican establishment is incredulous that he is their most likely nominee. Incredulous. Shocking. They say Donald lacks the foreign policy experience to be president. But in fairness, he has spent years meeting with leaders from around the world: Miss Sweden, Miss Argentina, Miss Azerbaijan. And there is one area where Donald's experience could be invaluable, and that's closing Guantanamo because Trump knows a thing or two about running waterfront properties into the ground. Alright, that is probably enough. I mean I've got more material. No, no, no. I don't want to spend too much time on The Donald. Following your lead, I want to show some restraint. Because I think we can all agree that from the start he's gotten the appropriate amount of coverage befitting the seriousness of his candidacy. Ha. I hope you all are proud of yourselves. The guy wanted to give his hotel business a boost and now we are praying that Cleveland makes it through July. Mmm mmm mmn. Hmmm.  As for me and Michelle, we've decided to stay in D.C. for a couple more years. Thank you. This way our youngest daughter can finish up high school. Michelle can stay closer to her plot of carrots. She's already making plans to see them every day. Take a look [image of Michelle].  But our decision has actually presented a bit of a dilemma because traditionally presidents don't stick around after they're done. And it's something that I've been brooding about a little bit. Take a look...  There you go. I am still waiting for all of you to respond to my invitation to connect to LinkedIn. But I know you have jobs to do which is what really brings us here tonight.  I know that there are times that we've had differences and that's inherent in our institutional roles. That is true of every president and his press corps. But we've always shared the same goal to root our public discourse in the truth. To open the doors of this democracy. To do whatever we can to make our country and our world more free and more just.  And I've always appreciated the role that you have all played as equal partners in reaching these goals. Our free press is why we once again recognize the real journalists who uncover the horrifying scandal and brought some measure of justice for thousands of victims around the world. They are here with us tonight: Sacha Pfeiffer, Mike Rezendes, Walter Robinson, Matt Caroll and Ben Bradlee Jr. Please give them a big round of applause.  A free press is why, once again, we honor Jason Rezaian, as Carol noted. Last time this year we spoke of Jason's courage as he endured the isolation of an Iranian prison. This year we see that courage in the flesh, and it's a living testament to the very idea of a free press and a reminder of the rising level of danger and political intimidation and the physical threats faced by reporters overseas.  And I can make this commitment that as long as I hold this office my administration will continue to fight for the release of American journalists held against their will. And we will not stop until they see the same freedom as Jason had.  At home and abroad journalists like all of you engage in the dogged pursuit of informing citizens and holding leaders accountable, and making our government of the people possible. And it's an enormous responsibility. And I realize it's an enormous challenge at a time when the economics of the business sometimes incentivizes speed over depth, and when controversy and conflict are what most immediately attract readers and viewers. The good news is there are so many of you that are pushing against those trends and as a citizen of this great democracy, I am grateful for that.  For this is also a time around the world when some of the fundamental ideals of liberal democracies are under attack and when notions of objectively and of a free press and of facts and of evidence are trying to be undermined or in some cases ignored entirely. And in such a climate it's not enough just to give people a megaphone. And that's why your power and your responsibility to dig and to question and to counter distortions and untruths is more important than even ever.  Taking a stand on behalf of what is true does not require you shedding your objectivity. In fact, it is the essence of good journalism. It affirms the idea that the only way we can build consensus, the only way that we can move forward as a country, the only way we can help the world mend itself is by agreeing on a baseline of facts when it comes to the challenges that confront us all. So this night is a testament to all of you who have devoted your lives to that idea, who push to shine a light on the truth every single day. So, I want to close my final White House correspondents' dinner by just saying thank you. I'm very proud of what you've done. It has been an honor and a privilege to work side by side with you to strengthen our democracy. With that I just have two more words to say: Obama out. [Drops mic].6Embed",

        "#11 Rhye - Woman Lyrics[Click here for soundtrack]  The first time we heard Rhye was when they released their stunning single \"Open.\" Every person who heard this track thought of Sade. You're a liar if you didn't. \"Who is this girl with this deep velvety voice?\" everyone asked. Except we would come to find out (and some of us are about to find out right now) that this wasn't a woman singing at all, but rather Canadian singer Mike Milosh. Rhye's producer is Danish-born Robin Hannibal and together they created a remarkable album of sensual grooves and love songsWoman begins with the aforementioned \"Open\" and if it wasn't clear that this is an album you make love to, just watch the video for \"Open.\" But it's the album's 2nd song, \"The Fall\" that lingers with you long after it's stopped playing. As Hannibal's piano hovers alongside a jazz drum beat and string arrangement while Milosh sings:The song is gone It fell into the fall But I don't want it this way Why can't you stay?The recurring theme of the album is set forth; that of maintaining the strength of your relationship when your life is constantly on the move. Not just any relationship, but the one... yearning for a love (and lust) so deeply rooted that it inspires the authenticity of the passionate expression we're graced with. Most of these songs were written by Milosh to his now-wife and there is no lack of passion on this record like on the album's crown jewel, \"3 Days\":Oh, I'm famished So I'll eat your minerals Like a rabid beast at a foolish feast I'll steal your breathWhen I think of the lyrics on this album the first line that comes to mind is \"so I'll eat your minerals.\" It perfectly describes the nature of the sexual human beast. It's running your hands down your lover's naked body like an animal. We all have these carnal passions in us and Milosh lays it down here like no other. Think of the rhythm of the action described within the rhythm of the beat. The first effect we hear sounds like a sputtering trumpet punctuating for 5 beats and the 6th beat in the measure is the piano. This is some jazzy stuff  I could sit here and break down more of the music and lyrics, but this album NEEDS to be experienced. You have to hear the horn samples. You HAVE to be left in amazement of his nearly impossible voice. You HAVE to think about how much the opening to \"Shed Some Blood\" is reminiscent of Air's \"Universal Traveller.\" You HAVE to yearn for Sade's classic LP  Promise, cause nothing has come this close to her sound before. Woman is in the same breath as great sensual albums of our time like D'Angelo's Voodoo and Frank Ocean's Channel Orange. Do what you will with this information and thank me later.

        "River of Tears Lyrics[Verse 1] It's three miles to the river That would carry me away And two miles to the dusty street That I saw you on today It's four miles to my lonely room Where I'm going to hide my face And about half a mile to the downtown bar That I ran from in disgrace  [Chorus] Lord, how long have I got to keep on running? Seven hours, seven days or seven years? All I know is, since you've been gone Feel like I'm drowning in a river Drowning in a river of tears Drowning in a river Feel like I'm drowning Drowning in a river  [Verse 2] In three more days, I'll leave this town And disappear without a trace A year from now, maybe settle down Where no one knows my face I wish that I could hold you One more time to ease the pain But my time's run out and I got to go Got to run away again [Chorus] Still I catch myself thinking One day I'll find my way back here You'll save me from drowning Drowning in a river Drowning in a river of tears Drowning in a river Feel like I'm drowning Drowning in a river Lord, how long must it go on?

        "Of This Land LyricsHow gentle was the breeze that surrounded the way How loud the sea's roar on the four winds everyday Sharing love, wounded gifts from ancient long ago Together they closed in the circles we know  Will we treasure all the secrets with life's changing scenes? Where our hearts were warm with love, so much love Will the flowers grow again as I open out my hand? Precious time, time for healing the beauty of this land (2x)  How soulful those words that confuses the way How wild the mountains' stare as they guard our every day Take for granted noble hearts in the golden age that's flown Between us, recall on a strong road we've known  Will we treasure all the secrets with life's changing scenes? Where our hearts were warm with love, so much love Will the flowers grow again as I open out my hand? Precious time, time for healing the beauty of this landEmbed",
        "Happy LyricsSadness had been close as my next of kin Then Happy came one day, chased my blues away My life began when Happy smiled Sweet, like candy to a child Stay here and love me just a while Let sadness see what Happy does Let Happy be where Sadness was  Happy, that's you You made my life brand new Lost as a little lam was I till you came in My life began when Happy smiled Sweet, like candy to a child Stay here and love me just a while Let sadness see what Happy does Let Happy be where Sadness was (Till now)  Where have I been? What lifetime was I in? Suspended between time and space Lonely until Happy came smiling up at me Sadness had no choice but to flee I said a prayer so silently Let Sadness see what Happy does Let Happy be where Sadness was till nowEmbed",

Before it's brushed aside Just as it's swept away  It's just the evidence It's of no consequence It's only flesh and bone Why don't you leave it alone?  If dust could only speak Caught in a falling beam If dust could only cry If dust could only scream For it's the single witness that might testify Could I spit out the truth? Or would you rather just swallow a lie?  But dust is always caught behind a coat of paint Beneath the marble fingernails of kings and saints And in the theatre curtain where they hang a drape Or in the ticket pocket where your hands escape  Before they start to wander Or they start to shrink You rub your eye a little and appear to blink And then she caught you staring She knows just what you're thinking What got into you was not a ghost as such It was just dust Here comes the juggernaut Here come The Poisoners They choke the life and land And rob the joy from us Why do they taste of sugar Oh, when they're made of money Here comes the lamb of God And the butcher's boy, Sonny  Well I believe we just Become a speck of dust...Embed",

        "Chapter 16 (The Grapes of Wrath) LyricsJOADS AND WILSONS crawled westward as a unit: El Reno and Bridgeport, Clinton, Elk City, Sayre, and Texola. There's the border, and Oklahoma was behind. And this day the cars crawled on and on, through the Panhandle of Texas. Shamrock and Alanreed, Groom and Yarnell. They went through Amarillo in the evening, drove too long, and camped when it was dusk. They were tired and dusty and hot. Granma had convulsions from the heat, and she was weak when they stopped. That night Al stole a fence rail and made a ridge pole on the truck, braced at both ends. That night they ate nothing but pan biscuits, cold and hard, held over from breakfast. They flopped down on the mattresses and slept in their clothes. The Wilsons didn't even put up their tent. Joads and Wilsons were in flight across the Panhandle, the rolling gray country, lined and cut with old flood scars. They were in flight out of Oklahoma and across Texas. The land turtles crawled through the dust and the sun whipped the earth, and in the evening the heat went out of the sky and the earth sent up a wave of heat from itself. Two days the families were in flight, but on the third the land was too huge for them and they settled into a new technique of living; the highway became their home and movement their medium of expression. Little by little they settled into the new life. Ruthie and Winfield first, then Al, then Connie and Rose of Sharon, and, last, the older ones. The land rolled like great stationary ground swells. Wildorado and Vega and Boise and Glenrio. That's the end of Texas. New Mexico and the mountains. In the far distance, waved up against the sky, the mountains stood. And the wheels of the cars creaked around, and the engines were hot, and the steam spurted around the radiator caps. They crawled to the Pecos river, and crossed at Santa Rosa. And they went on for twenty miles. AL JOAD drove the touring car, and his mother sat beside him, and Rose of Sharon beside her. Ahead the truck crawled. The hot air folded in waves over the land, and the mountains shivered in the heat. Al drove listlessly, hunched back in the seat, his hand hooked easily over the cross-bar of the steering wheel; his gray hat, peaked and pulled to an incredibly cocky shape, was low over one eye; and as he drove, he turned and spat out the side now and then. Ma, beside him, had folded her hands in her lap, had retired into a resistance against weariness. She sat loosely, letting the movement of the car sway her body and her head. She squinted her eyes ahead at the mountains. Rose of Sharon was braced against the movement of the car, her feet pushed tight against the floor, and her right elbow hooked over the door. And her plump face was tight against the movement, and her head jiggled sharply because her neck muscles were tight. She tried to arch her whole body as a rigid container to preserve her fetus from shock. She turned her head toward her mother. \"Ma,\" she said. Ma's eyes lighted up and she drew her attention toward Rose of Sharon. Her eyes went over the tight, tired, plump face, and she smiled. \"Ma,\" the girl said, \"when we get there, all you gonna pick fruit an' kinda live in the country, ain't you?\" Ma smiled a little satirically. \"We ain't there yet,\" she said. \"We don't know what it's like. We got to see.\" \"Me an' Connie don't want to live in the country no more,\" the girl said. \"We got it all planned up what we gonna do.\" For a moment a little worry came on Ma's face. \"Ain't you gonna stay with us-- with the family?\" she asked. \"Well, we talked all about it, me an' Connie. Ma, we wanna live in a town.\" She went on excitedly. \"Connie gonna get a job in a store or maybe a fact'ry. An' he's gonna study at home, maybe radio, so he can git to be a expert an' maybe later have his own store. An' we'll go to pitchers whenever. An' Connie says I'm gonna have a doctor when the baby's born; an' he says we'll see how times is, an' maybe I'll go to a hospiddle. An' we'll have a car, little car. An' after he studies at night, why--it'll be nice, an' he tore a page outa Western Love Stories, an' he's gonna send off for a course, 'cause it don't cost nothin' to send off. Says right on that clipping. I seen it. An' why-- they even get you a job when you take that course--radios, it is--nice clean work, and a future. An' we'll live in town an' go to pitchers whenever an'--well, I'm gonna have a 'lectric iron, an' the baby'll have all new stuff. Connie says all new stuff--white an'-- Well, you seen in the catalogue all the stuff they got for a baby. Maybe right at first while Connie's studyin' at home it won't be easy, but--well, when the baby comes, maybe he'll be all done studyin' an' we'll have a place, little bit of a place. We don't want nothin' fancy, but we want it nice for the baby--\" Her face glowed with excitement. \"An' I thought--well, I thought maybe we could all go in town, an' when Connie gets his store--maybe Al could work for him.\" Ma's eyes had never left the flushing face. Ma watched the structure grow and followed it. \"We don' want you to go 'way from us,\" she said. \"It ain't good for folks to break up.\" Al snorted, \"Me work for Connie? How about Connie comes a-workin' for me? He thinks he's the on'y son-of-a-bitch can study at night?\" Ma suddenly seemed to know it was all a dream. She turned her head forward again and her body relaxed, but the little smile stayed around her eyes. \"I wonder how Granma feels today,\" she said. Al grew tense over the wheel. A little rattle had developed in the engine. He speeded up and the rattle increased. He retarded his spark and listened, and then he speeded up for a moment and listened. The rattle increased to a metallic pounding. Al blew his horn and pulled the car to the side of the road. Ahead the truck pulled up and then backed slowly. Three cars raced by, westward, and each one blew its horn and the last driver leaned out and yelled, \"Where the hell ya think you're stoppin'?\" Tom backed the truck close, and then he got out and walked to the touring car. From the back of the loaded truck heads looked down. Al retarded his spark and listened to his idling motor. Tom asked, \"What's a matter, Al?\" Al speeded the motor. \"Listen to her.\" The rattling pound was louder now. Tom listened. \"Put up your spark an' idle,\" he said. He opened the hood and put his head inside. \"Now speed her.\" He listened for a moment and then closed the hood. \"Well, I guess you're right, Al,\" he said. \"Con-rod bearing, ain't it?\" \"Sounds like it,\" said Tom. \"I kep' plenty oil in,\" Al complained. \"Well, it jus' didn' get to her. Drier'n a bitch monkey now. Well, there ain't nothin' to do but tear her out. Look, I'll pull ahead an' find a flat place to stop. You come ahead slow. Don't knock the pan out of her.\" Wilson asked, \"Is it bad?\" \"Purty bad,\" said Tom, and walked back to the truck and moved slowly ahead. Al explained, \"I don't know what made her go out. I give her plenty of oil.\" Al knew the blame was on him. He felt his failure. Ma said, \"It ain't your fault. You done ever'thing right.\" And then she asked a little timidly, \"Is it terrible bad?\" \"Well, it's hard to get at, an' we got to get a new con-rod or else some babbitt in this one.\" He sighed deeply. \"I sure am glad Tom's here. I never fitted no bearing. Hope to Jesus Tom did.\" A huge red billboard stood beside the road ahead, and it threw a great oblong shadow. Tom edged the truck off the road and across the shallow roadside ditch, and he pulled up in the shadow. He got out and waited until Al came up. \"Now go easy,\" he called. \"Take her slow or you'll break a spring too.\" Al's face went red with anger. He throttled down his motor. \"Goddamn it,\" he yelled, \"I didn't burn that bearin' out! What d'ya mean, I'll bust a spring too?\" Tom grinned. \"Keep all four feet on the groun',\" he said. \"I didn' mean nothin'. Just take her easy over this ditch.\" Al grumbled as he inched the touring car down, and up the other side. \"Don't you go givin' nobody no idear I burned out that bearin'.\" The engine clattered loudly now. Al pulled into the shade and shut down the motor. Tom lifted the hood and braced it. \"Can't even start on her before she cools off,\" he said. The family piled down from the cars and clustered about the touring car. Pa asked, \"How bad?\" And he squatted on his hams. Tom turned to Al. \"Ever fitted one?\" \"No,\" said Al, \"I never. 'Course I had pans off.\" Tom said, \"Well, we got to tear the pan off an' get the rod out, an' we got to get a new part an' hone her an' shim her an' fit her. Good day's job. Got to go back to that las' place for a part, Santa Rosa. Albuquerque's about seventy-five miles on--Oh, Jesus, tomorra's Sunday! We can't get nothin' tomorra.\" The family stood silently. Ruthie crept close and peered into the open hood, hoping to see the broken part. Tom went on softly, \"Tomorra's Sunday. Monday we'll get the thing an' prob'ly won't get her fitted 'fore Tuesday. We ain't got the tools to make it easy. Gonna be a job.\" The shadow of a buzzard slid across the earth, and the family all looked up at the sailing black bird. Pa said, \"What I'm scairt of is we'll run outa money so we can't git there 't all. Here's all us eatin', an' got to buy gas an' oil. 'F we run outa money, I don' know what we gonna do.\" Wilson said, \"Seems like it's my fault. This here goddamn wreck's give me trouble right along. You folks been nice to us. Now you jus' pack up an' get along. Me an' Sairy'll stay, an' we'll figger some way. We don't aim to put you folks out none.\" Pa said slowly. \"We ain't a-gonna do it. We got almost a kin bond. Grampa, he died in your tent.\" Sairy said tiredly, \"We been nothin' but trouble, nothin' but trouble.\" Tom slowly made a cigarette, and inspected it and lighted it. He took off his ruined cap and wiped his forehead. \"I got an idear,\" he said. \"Maybe nobody gonna like it, but here she is: The nearer to California our folks get, the quicker they's gonna be money rollin' in. Now this here car'll go twicet as fast as that truck. Now here's my idea. You take out some a that stuff in the truck, an' then all you folks but me an' the preacher get in an' move on. Me an' Casy'll stop here an' fix this here car an' then we drive on, day an' night, an' we'll catch up, or if we don't meet on the road, you'll be a-workin' anyways. An' if you break down, why, jus' camp 'longside the road till we come. You can't be no worse off, an' if you get through, why, you'll be a-workin', an' stuff'll be easy. Casy can give me a lif' with this here car, an' we'll come a-sailin'.\" The gathered family considered it. Uncle John dropped to his hams beside Pa. Al said, \"Won't ya need me to give ya a han' with that con-rod?\" \"You said your own se'f you never fixed one.\" \"That's right,\" Al agreed. \"All ya got to have is a strong back. Maybe the preacher don' wanta stay.\" \"Well--whoever--I don' care,\" said Tom. Pa scratched the dry earth with his forefinger. \"I kind a got a notion Tom's right,\" he said. \"It ain't goin' ta do no good all of us stayin' here. We can get fifty, a hunderd miles on 'fore dark.\" Ma said worriedly, \"How you gonna find us?\" \"We'll be on the same road,\" said Tom. \"Sixty-six right on through. Come to a place name' Bakersfiel'. Seen it on the map I got. You go straight on there.\" \"Yeah, but when we get to California an' spread out sideways off this road--?\" \"Don't you worry,\" Tom reassured her. \"We're gonna find ya. California ain't the whole world.\" \"Looks like an awful big place on the map,\" said Ma. Pa appealed for advice. \"John, you see any reason why not?\" \"No,\" said John. \"Mr. Wilson, it's your car. You got any objections if my boy fixes her an' brings her on?\" \"I don't see none,\" said Wilson. \"Seems like you folks done ever'thing for us awready. Don' see why I cain't give your boy a han'.\" \"You can be workin', layin' in a little money, if we don' ketch up with ya,\" said Tom. \"An' suppose we all jus' lay aroun' here. There ain't no water here, an' we can't move this here car. But s'pose you all git out there an' git to work. Why, you'd have money, an' maybe a house to live in. How about it, Casy? Wanna stay with me an' gimme a lif'?\" \"I wanna do what's bes' for you folks,\" said Casy. \"You took me in, carried me along. I'll do whatever.\" \"Well, you'll lay on your back an' get grease in your face if you stay here,\" Tom said. \"Suits me awright.\" Pa said, \"Well, if that's the way she's gonna go, we better get a-shovin'. We can maybe squeeze in a hunderd miles 'fore we stop.\" Ma stepped in front of him. \"I ain't a-gonna go.\" \"What you mean, you ain't gonna go? You got to go. You got to look after the family.\" Pa was amazed at the revolt. Ma stepped to the touring car and reached in on the floor of the back seat. She brought out a jack handle and balanced it in her hand easily. \"I ain't a-gonna go,\" she said. \"I tell you, you got to go. We made up our mind.\" And now Ma's mouth set hard. She said softly, \"On'y way you gonna get me to go is whup me.\" She moved the jack handle gently again. \"An' I'll shame you, Pa. I won't take no whuppin', cryin' an' a-beggin'. I'll light into you. An' you ain't so sure you can whup me anyways. An' if ya do get me, I swear to God I'll wait till you got your back turned, or you're settin' down, an' I'll knock you belly-up with a bucket. I swear to Holy Jesus' sake I will.\" Pa looked helplessly about the group. \"She sassy,\" he said. \"I never seen her so sassy.\" Ruthie giggled shrilly. The jack handle flicked hungrily back and forth in Ma's hand. \"Come on,\" said Ma. \"You made up your mind. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it. But I ain't a-goin'; or if I do, you ain't gonna get no sleep, 'cause I'll wait an' I'll wait, an' jus' the minute you take sleep in your eyes, I'll slap ya with a stick a stove wood.\" \"So goddamn sassy,\" Pa murmured. \"An' she ain't young, neither.\" The whole group watched the revolt. They watched Pa, waiting for him to break into fury. They watched his lax hands to see the fists form. And Pa's anger did not rise, and his hands hung limply at his sides. And in a moment the group knew that Ma had won. And Ma knew it too. Tom said, \"Ma, what's eatin' on you? What ya wanna do this-a-way for? What's the matter'th you anyways? You gone johnrabbit on us?\" Ma's face softened, but her eyes were still fierce. \"You done this 'thout thinkin' much,\" Ma said. \"What we got lef' in the worl'? Nothin' but us. Nothin' but the folks. We come out an' Grampa he reached for the shovel-shelf right off. An' now, right off, you wanna bust up the folks--\" Tom cried, \"Ma, we gonna catch up with ya. We wasn't gonna be gone long.\" Ma waved the jack handle. \"S'pose we was camped, and you went on by. S'pose we got on through, how'd we know where to leave the word, an' how'd you know where to ask?\" She said, \"We got a bitter road. Granma's sick. She's up there on the truck apawin' for a shovel herself. She's jus' tar'd out. We got a long bitter road ahead.\" Uncle John said, \"But we could be makin' some money. We could have a little bit saved up, come time the other folks got there.\" The eyes of the whole family shifted back to Ma. She was the power. She had taken control. \"The money we'd make wouldn't do no good,\" she said. \"All we got is the family unbroke. Like a bunch a cows, when the lobos are ranging, stick all together. I ain't scared while we're all here, all that's alive, but I ain't gonna see us bust up. The Wilsons here is with us, an' the preacher is with us. I can't say nothin' if they want to go, but I'm a-goin' cat-wild with this here piece a bar-arn if my own folks busts up.\" Her tone was cold and final. Tom said soothingly, \"Ma, we can't all camp here. Ain't no water here. Ain't even much shade here. Granma, she needs shade.\" \"All right,\" said Ma. \"We'll go along. We'll stop first place they's water an' shade. An'--the truck'll come back an' take you in town to get your part, an' it'll bring you back. You ain't goin' walkin' along in the sun, an' I ain't havin' you out all alone, so if you get picked up there ain't nobody of your folks to he'p ya.\" Tom drew his lips over his teeth and then snapped them open. He spread his hands helplessly and let them flop against his sides. \"Pa,\" he said, \"if you was to rush her one side an' me the other an' then the res' pile on, an' Granma jump down on top, maybe we can get Ma 'thout more'n two-three of us gets killed with that there jack handle. But if you ain't willin' to get your head smashed, I guess Ma's went an' filled her flush. Jesus Christ, one person with their mind made up can shove a lot of folks aroun'! You win, Ma. Put away that jack handle 'fore you hurt somebody.\" Ma looked in astonishment at the bar of iron. Her hand trembled. She dropped her weapon on the ground, and Tom, with elaborate care, picked it up and put it back in the car. He said, \"Pa, you jus' got set back on your heels. Al, you drive the folks on an' get 'em camped, an' then you bring the truck back here. Me an' the preacher'll get the pan off. Then, if we can make it, we'll run in Santa Rosa an' try an' get a con-rod. Maybe we can, seein' it's Sat'dy night. Get jumpin' now so we can go. Lemme have the monkey wrench an' pliers outa the truck.\" He reached under the car and felt the greasy pan. \"Oh, yeah, lemme have a can, that ol' bucket, to catch the oil. Got to save that.\" Al handed over the bucket and Tom set it under the car and loosened the oil cap with a pair of pliers. The black oil flowed down his arm while he unscrewed the cap with his fingers, and then the black stream ran silently into the bucket. Al had loaded the family on the truck by the time the bucket was half full. Tom, his face already smudged with oil, looked out between the wheels. \"Get back fast!\" he called. And he was loosening the pan bolts as the truck moved gently across the shallow ditch and crawled away. Tom turned each bolt a single turn, loosening them evenly to spare the gasket. The preacher knelt beside the wheels. \"What can I do?\" \"Nothin', not right now. Soon's the oil's out an' I get these here bolts loose, you can he'p me drop the pan off.\" He squirmed away under the car, loosening the bolts with a wrench and turning them out with his fingers. He left the bolts on each end loosely threaded to keep the pan from dropping. \"Ground's still hot under here,\" Tom said. And then, \"Say, Casy, you been awful goddamn quiet the las' few days. Why, Jesus! When I first come up with you, you was makin' a speech ever' half-hour or so. An' here you ain't said ten words the las' couple days. What's a matter--gettin' sour?\" Casy was stretched out on his stomach, looking under the car. His chin, bristly with sparse whiskers, rested on the back of one hand. His hat was pushed back so that it covered the back of his neck. \"I done enough talkin' when I was a preacher to las' the rest a my life,\" he said. \"Yeah, but you done some talkin' sence, too.\" \"I'm all worried up,\" Casy said. \"I didn' even know it when I was a-preachin' aroun', but I was doin' consid'able tom-cattin' aroun'. If I ain't gonna preach no more, I got to get married. Why, Tommy, I'm a-lustin' after the flesh.\" \"Me too,\" said Tom. \"Say, the day I come outa McAlester I was smokin'. I run me down a girl, a hoor girl, like she was a rabbit. I won't tell ya what happened. I wouldn't tell nobody what happened.\" Casy laughed. \"I know what happened. I went a-fastin' into the wilderness one time, an' when I come out the same damn thing happened to me.\" \"Hell it did!\" said Tom. \"Well, I saved my money anyway, an' I give that girl a run. Thought I was nuts. I should a paid her, but I on'y got five bucks to my name. She said she didn't want no money. Here, roll in under here an' grab a-holt. I'll tap her loose. Then you turn out that bolt an' I turn out my end, an' we let her down easy. Careful that gasket. See, she comes off in one piece. They's on'y four cylinders to these here ol' Dodges. I took one down one time. Got main bearings big as a cantaloupe. Now--let her down--hold it. Reach up an' pull down that gasket where it's stuck--easy now. There!\" The greasy pan lay on the ground between them, and a little oil still lay in the wells. Tom reached into one of the front wells and picked out some broken pieces of babbitt. \"There she is,\" he said. He turned the babbitt in his fingers. \"Shaft's up. Look in back an' get the crank. Turn her over till I tell you.\" Casy got to his feet and found the crank and fitted it. \"Ready?\" \"Reach--now easy--little more--little more--right there.\" Casy kneeled down and looked under again. Tom rattled the connecting-rod bearing against the shaft. \"There she is.\" \"What ya s'pose done it?\" Casy asked. \"Oh, hell, I don' know! This buggy been on the road thirteen years. Says sixtythousand miles on the speedometer. That means a hunderd an' sixty, an' God knows how many times they turned the numbers back. Gets hot--maybe somebody let the oil get low--jus' went out.\" He pulled the cotter-pins and put his wrench on a bearing bolt. He strained and the wrench slipped. A long gash appeared on the back of his hand. Tom looked at it--the blood flowed evenly from the wound and met the oil and dripped into the pan. \"That's too bad,\" Casy said. \"Want I should do that an' you wrap up your han'?\" \"Hell, no! I never fixed no car in my life 'thout cuttin' myself. Now it's done I don't have to worry no more.\" He fitted the wrench again. \"Wisht I had a crescent wrench,\" he said, and he hammered the wrench with the butt of his hand until the bolts loosened. He took them out and laid them with the pan bolts in the pan, and the cotter-pins with them. He loosened the bearing bolts and pulled out the piston. He put piston and connecting-rod in the pan. \"There, by God!\" He squirmed free from under the car and pulled the pan out with him. He wiped his hand on a piece of gunny sacking and inspected the cut. \"Bleedin' like a son-of-a-bitch,\" he said. \"Well, I can stop that.\" He urinated on the ground, picked up a handful of the resulting mud, and plastered it over the wound. Only for a moment did the blood ooze out, and then it stopped. \"Best damn thing in the worl' to stop bleedin',\" he said. \"Han'ful a spider web'll do it too,\" said Casy. \"I know, but there ain't no spider web, an' you can always get piss.\" Tom sat on the running board and inspected the broken bearing. \"Now if we can on'y find a '25 Dodge an' get a used con-rod an' some shims, maybe we'll make her all right. Al must a gone a hell of a long ways.\" The shadow of the billboard was sixty feet out by now. The afternoon lengthened away. Casy sat down on the running board and looked westward. \"We gonna be in high mountains pretty soon,\" he said, and he was silent for a few moments. Then, \"Tom!\" \"Yeah?\" \"Tom, I been watchin' the cars on the road, them we passed an' them that passed us. I been keepin' track.\" \"Track a what?\" \"Tom, they's hunderds a families like us all a-goin' west. I watched. There ain't none of 'em goin' east--hunderds of 'em. Did you notice that?\" \"Yeah, I noticed.\" \"Why--it's like--it's like they was runnin' away from soldiers. It's like a whole country is movin'.\" \"Yeah,\" Tom said. \"They is a whole country movin'. We're movin' too.\" \"Well--s'pose all these here folks an' ever'body--s'pose they can't get no jobs out there?\" \"Goddamn it!\" Tom cried. \"How'd I know? I'm jus' puttin' one foot in front a the other. I done it at Mac for four years, jus' marchin' in cell an' out cell an' in mess an' out mess. Jesus Christ, I thought it'd be somepin different when I come out! Couldn't think a nothin' in there, else you go stir happy, an' now can't think a nothin'.\" He turned on Casy. \"This here bearing went out. We didn' know it was goin' so we didn' worry none. Now she's out an' we'll fix her. An' by Christ that goes for the rest of it! I ain't gonna worry. I can't do it. This here little piece of iron an' babbitt. See it? Ya see it? Well, that's the only goddamn thing in the world I got on my mind. I wonder where the hell Al is.\" Casy said, \"Now look, Tom. Oh, what the hell! So goddamn hard to say anything.\" Tom lifted the mud pack from his hand and threw it on the ground. The edge of the wound was lined with dirt. He glanced over to the preacher. \"You're fixin' to make a speech,\" Tom said. \"Well, go ahead. I like speeches. Warden used to make speeches all the time. Didn't do us no harm an' he got a hell of a bang out of it! What you tryin' to roll out?\" Casy picked the backs of his long knotty fingers. \"They's stuff goin' on and they's folks doin' things. Them people layin' one foot down in front of the other, like you says, they ain't thinkin' where they're goin', like you says--but they're all layin' 'em down the same direction, jus' the same. An' if ya listen, you'll hear a movin', an' a sneakin', an' a rustlin', an'--an' a res'lessness. They's stuff goin' on that the folks doin' it don't know nothin' about--yet. They's gonna come somepin outa all these folks goin' wes'--outa all their farms lef' lonely. They's gonna come a thing that's gonna change the whole country.\" Tom said, \"I'm still layin' my dogs down one at a time.\" \"Yeah, but when a fence comes up at ya, ya gonna climb that fence.\" \"I climb fences when I got fences to climb,\" said Tom. Casy sighed. \"It's the bes' way. I gotta agree. But they's different kinda fences. They's folks like me that climbs fences that ain't even strang up yet--an' can't he'p it.\" \"Ain't that Al a-comin'?\" Tom asked. \"Yeah. Looks like.\" Tom stood up and wrapped the connecting-rod and both halves of the bearing in the piece of sack. \"Wanta make sure I get the same,\" he said. The truck pulled alongside the road and Al leaned out the window. Tom said, \"You was a hell of a long time. How far'd you go?\" Al sighed. \"Got the rod out?\" \"Yeah.\" Tom held up the sack. \"Babbitt jus' broke down.\" \"Well, it wasn't no fault of mine,\" said Al. \"No. Where'd you take the folks?\" \"We had a mess,\" Al said. \"Granma got to bellerin', an' that set Rosasharn off an' she bellered some. Got her head under a mattress an' bellered. But Granma, she was just layin' back her jaw an' bayin' like a moonlight houn' dog. Seems like Granma ain't got no sense no more. Like a little baby. Don' speak to nobody, don' seem to reco'nize nobody. Jus' talks on like she's talkin' to Grampa.\" \"Where'd ya leave 'em?\" Tom insisted. \"Well, we come to a camp. Got shade an' got water in pipes. Costs half a dollar a day to stay there. But ever'body's so goddamn tired an' wore out an' mis'able, they stayed there. Ma says they got to 'cause Granma's so tired an' wore out. Got Wilson's tent up an' got our tarp for a tent. I think Granma gone nuts.\" Tom looked toward the lowering sun. \"Casy,\" he said, \"somebody got to stay with this car or she'll get stripped. You jus' as soon?\" \"Sure. I'll stay.\" Al took a paper bag from the seat. \"This here's some bread an' meat Ma sent, an' I got a jug a water here.\" \"She don't forget nobody,\" said Casy. Tom got in beside Al. \"Look,\" he said. \"We'll get back jus' as soon's we can. But we can't tell how long.\" \"I'll be here.\" \"Awright. Don't make no speeches to yourself. Get goin', Al.\" The truck moved off in the late afternoon. \"He's a nice fella,\" Tom said. \"He thinks about stuff all the time.\" \"Well, hell--if you been a preacher, I guess you got to. Pa's all mad about it costs fifty cents jus' to camp under a tree. He can't see that noways. Settin' a-cussin'. Says nex' thing they'll sell ya a little tank a air. But Ma says they gotta be near shade an' water 'cause a Granma.\" The truck rattled along the highway, and now that it was unloaded, every part of it rattled and clashed. The side-board of the bed, the cut body. It rode hard and light. Al put it up to thirty-eight miles an hour and the engine clattered heavily and a blue smoke of burning oil drifted up through the floor boards. \"Cut her down some,\" Tom said. \"You gonna burn her right down to the hub caps. What's eatin' on Granma?\" \"I don't know. 'Member the las' couple days she's been airy-nary, sayin' nothin' to nobody? Well, she's yellin' an' talkin' plenty now, on'y she's talkin' to Grampa. Yellin' at him. Kinda scary, too. You can almos' see 'im a-settin' there grinnin' at her the way he always done, a-fingerin' hisself an' grinnin'. Seems like she sees him a-settin' there, too. She's jus' givin' him hell. Say, Pa, he give me twenty dollars to hand you. He don' know how much you gonna need. Ever see Ma stand up to 'im like she done today?\" \"Not I remember. I sure did pick a nice time to get paroled. I figgered I was gonna lay aroun' an' get up late an' eat a lot when I come home. I was goin' out and dance, an' I was gonna go tom-cattin'--an' here I ain't had time to do none of them things.\" Al said, \"I forgot. Ma give me a lot a stuff to tell you. She says don't drink nothin', an' don' get in no arguments, an' don't fight nobody. 'Cause she says she's scairt you'll get sent back.\" \"She got plenty to get worked up about 'thout me givin' her no trouble,\" said Tom. \"Well, we could get a couple beers, can't we? I'm jus' a-ravin' for a beer.\" \"I dunno,\" said Tom. \"Pa'd crap a litter of lizards if we buy beers.\" \"Well, look, Tom. I got six dollars. You an' me could get a couple pints an' go down the line. Nobody don't know I got that six bucks. Christ, we could have a hell of a time for ourselves.\" \"Keep ya jack,\" Tom said. \"When we get out to the coast you an' me'll take her an' we'll raise hell. Maybe when we're workin'--\" He turned in the seat. \"I didn' think you was a fella to go down the line. I figgered you was talkin' 'em out of it.\" \"Well, hell, I don't know nobody here. If I'm gonna ride aroun' much, I'm gonna get married. I'm gonna have me a hell of a time when we get to California.\" \"Hope so,\" said Tom. \"You ain't sure a nothin' no more.\" \"No, I ain't sure a nothin'.\" \"When ya killed that fella--did--did ya ever dream about it or anything? Did it worry ya?\" \"No.\" \"Well, didn' ya never think about it?\" \"Sure. I was sorry 'cause he was dead.\" \"Ya didn't take no blame to yourself?\" \"No. I done my time, an' I done my own time.\" \"Was it--awful bad--there?\" Tom said nervously, \"Look, Al. I done my time, an' now it's done. I don' wanna do it over an' over. There's the river up ahead, an' there's the town. Let's jus' try an' get a con-rod an' the hell with the res' of it.\" \"Ma's awful partial to you,\" said Al. \"She mourned when you was gone. Done it all to herself. Kinda cryin' down inside of her throat. We could tell what she was thinkin' about, though.\" Tom pulled his cap down low over his eyes. \"Now look here, Al. S'pose we talk 'bout some other stuff.\" \"I was jus' tellin' ya what Ma done.\" \"I know--I know. But--I ruther not. I ruther jus'--lay one foot down in front a the other.\" Al relapsed into an insulated silence. \"I was jus' tryin' to tell ya,\" he said, after a moment. Tom looked at him, and Al kept his eyes straight ahead. The lightened truck bounced noisily along. Tom's long lips drew up from his teeth and he laughed softly. \"I know you was, Al. Maybe I'm kinda stir-nuts. I'll tell ya about it sometime maybe. Ya see, it's jus' somepin you wanta know. Kinda interestin'. But I got a kind a funny idear the bes' thing'd be if I forget about it for a while. Maybe in a little while it won't be that way. Right now when I think about it my guts gets all droopy an' nasty feelin'. Look here, Al, I'll tell ya one thing--the jail house is jus' a kind a way a drivin' a guy slowly nuts. See? An' they go nuts, an' you see 'em an' hear 'em, an' pretty soon you don' know if you're nuts or not. When they get to screamin' in the night sometimes you think it's you doin' the screamin'--an' sometimes it is.\" Al said, \"Oh! I won't talk about it no more, Tom.\" \"Thirty days is all right,\" Tom said. \"An' a hunderd an' eighty days is all right. But over a year--I dunno. There's somepin about it that ain't like nothin' else in the worl'. Somepin screwy about it, somepin screwy about the whole idea a lockin' people up. Oh, the hell with it! I don' wanna talk about it. Look a the sun a-flashin' on them windas.\" The truck drove to the service-station belt, and there on the right-hand side of the road was a wrecking yard--an acre lot surrounded by a high barbed-wire fence, a corrugated iron shed in front with used tires piled up by the doors, and price-marked. Behind the shed there was a little shack built of scrap, scrap lumber and pieces of tin. The windows were windshields built into the walls. In the grassy lot the wrecks lay, cars with twisted, stove-in noses, wounded cars lying on their sides with the wheels gone. Engines rusting on the ground and against the shed. A great pile of junk; fenders and truck sides, wheels and axles; over the whole lot a spirit of decay, of mold and rust; twisted iron, half-gutted engines, a mass of derelicts. Al drove the truck up on the oily ground in front of the shed. Tom got out and looked into the dark doorway. \"Don't see nobody,\" he said, and he called, \"Anybody here?\" \"Jesus, I hope they got a '25 Dodge.\" Behind the shed a door banged. A specter of a man came through the dark shed. Thin, dirty, oily skin tight against stringy muscles. One eye was gone, and the raw, uncovered socket squirmed with eye muscles when his good eye moved. His jeans and shirt were thick and shiny with old grease, and his hands cracked and lined and cut. His heavy, pouting underlip hung out sullenly. Tom asked, \"You the boss?\" The one eye glared. \"I work for the boss,\" he said sullenly. \"Whatcha want?\" \"Got a wrecked '25 Dodge? We need a con-rod.\" \"I don't know. If the boss was here he could tell ya--but he ain't here. He's went home.\" \"Can we look an' see ?\" The man blew his nose into the palm of his hand and wiped his hand on his trousers. \"You from hereabouts?\" \"Come from east--goin' west.\" \"Look aroun' then. Burn the goddamn place down, for all I care.\" \"Looks like you don't love your boss none.\" The man shambled close, his one eye flashing. \"I hate 'im,\" he said softly. \"I hate the son-of-a-bitch! Gone home now. Gone home to his house.\" The words fell stumbling out. \"He got a way--he got a way a-pickin' a fella an' a-tearin' a fella. He-- the son-of-a-bitch. Got a girl nineteen, purty. Says to me, 'How'd ya like to marry her?' Says that right to me. An' tonight--says, 'They's a dance; how'd ya like to go?' Me, he says it to me!\" Tears formed in his eyes and tears dripped from the corner of the red eye socket. \"Some day, by God--some day I'm gonna have a pipe wrench in my pocket. When he says them things he looks at my eye. An' I'm gonna, I'm gonna jus' take his head right down off his neck with that wrench, little piece at a time.\" He panted with his fury. \"Little piece at a time, right down off'n his neck.\" The sun disappeared behind the mountains. Al looked into the lot at the wrecked cars. \"Over there, look, Tom! That there looks like a '25 or '26.\" Tom turned to the one-eyed man. \"Mind if we look?\" \"Hell, no! Take any goddamn thing you want.\" They walked, threading their way among the dead automobiles, to a rusting sedan, resting on flat tires. \"Sure it's a '25,\" Al cried. \"Can we yank off the pan, mister?\" Tom kneeled down and looked under the car. \"Pan's off awready. One rod's been took. Looks like one gone.\" He wriggled under the car. \"Get a crank an' turn her over, Al.\" He worked the rod against the shaft. \"Purty much froze with grease.\" Al turned the crank slowly. \"Easy,\" Tom called. He picked a splinter of wood from the ground and scraped the cake of grease from the bearing and the bearing bolts. \"How is she for tight?\" Al asked. \"Well, she's a little loose, but not bad.\" \"Well, how is she for wore?\" \"Got plenty shim. Ain't been all took up. Yeah, she's O.K. Turn her over easy now. Get her down, easy--there! Run over the truck an' get some tools.\" The one-eyed man said, \"I'll get you a box a tools.\" He shuffled off among the rusty cars and in a moment he came back with a tin box of tools. Tom dug out a socket wrench and handed it to Al. \"You take her off. Don' lose no shims an' don' let the bolts get away, an' keep track a the cotter-pins. Hurry up. The light's gettin' dim.\" Al crawled under the car. \"We oughta get us a set a socket wrenches,\" he called. \"Can't get in no place with a monkey wrench.\" \"Yell out if you want a hand,\" Tom said. The one-eyed man stood helplessly by. \"I'll help ya if ya want,\" he said. \"Know what that son-of-a-bitch done? He come by an' he got on white pants. An' he says, 'Come on, le's go out to my yacht.' By God, I'll whang him some day!\" He breathed heavily. \"I ain't been out with a woman sence I los' my eye. An' he says stuff like that.\" And big tears cut channels in the dirt beside his nose. Tom said impatiently, \"Whyn't you roll on? Got no guards to keep ya here.\" \"Yeah, that's easy to say. Ain't so easy to get a job--not for a one-eye' man.\" Tom turned on him. \"Now look-a-here, fella. You got that eye wide open. An' ya dirty, ya stink. Ya jus' askin' for it. Ya like it. Lets ya feel sorry for yaself. 'Course ya can't get no woman with that empty eye flappin' aroun'. Put somepin over it an' wash ya face. You ain't hittin' nobody with no pipe wrench.\" \"I tell ya, a one-eye' fella got a hard row.\" the man said. \"Can't see stuff the way other fellas can. Can't see how far off a thing is. Ever'thing's jus' flat.\" Tom said, \"Ya full a crap. Why, I knowed a one-legged whore one time. Think she was takin' two-bits in a alley? No, by God! She's gettin' half a dollar extra. She says, 'How many one-legged women you slep' with? None!' she says. 'O.K.,' she says. 'You got somepin pretty special here, an' it's gonna cos' ya half a buck extry'. An' by God, she was gettin' 'em, too, an' the fellas comin' out thinkin' they're pretty lucky. She says she's good luck. An' I knowed a hump-back in--in a place I was. Make his whole livin' lettin' folks rub his hump for luck. Jesus Christ, an' all you got is one eye gone.\" The man said stumblingly, \"Well, Jesus, ya see somebody edge away from ya, an' it gets into ya.\" \"Cover it up then, goddamn it. Ya stickin' it out like a cow's ass. Ya like to feel sorry for yaself. There ain't nothin' the matter with you. Buy yaself some white pants. Ya gettin' drunk an' cryin' in ya bed, I bet. Need any help, Al?\" \"No,\" said Al. \"I got this here bearin' loose. Jus' tryin' to work the piston down.\" \"Don' bang yaself,\" said Tom. The one-eyed man said softly, \"Think--somebody'd like--me?\" \"Why, sure,\" said Tom. \"Tell 'em ya dong's growed sence you los' your eye.\" \"Where at you fellas goin'?\" \"California. Whole family. Gonna get work out there.\" \"Well, ya think a fella like me could get work? Black patch on my eye?\" \"Why not? You ain't no cripple.\" \"Well--could I catch a ride with you fellas?\" \"Christ, no. We're so goddamn full now we can't move. You get out some other way. Fix up one a these here wrecks an' go out by yaself.\" \"Maybe I will, by God,\" said the one-eyed man. There was a clash of metal. \"I got her,\" Al called. \"Well, bring her out, let's look at her.\" Al handed him the piston and connecting-rod and the lower half of the bearing. Tom wiped the babbitt surface and sighted along it sideways. \"Looks O.K. to me,\" he said. \"Say, by God, if we had a light we could get this here in tonight.\" \"Say, Tom,\" Al said, \"I been thinkin'. We got no ring clamps. Gonna be a job gettin' them rings in, specially underneath.\" Tom said, \"Ya know, a fella tol' me one time ya wrap some fine brass wire aroun' the ring to hol' her.\" \"Yeah, but how ya gonna get the wire off?\" \"Ya don't get her off. She melts off an' don't hurt nothin'.\" \"Copper wire'd be better.\" \"It ain't strong enough,\" said Tom. He turned to the one-eyed man. \"Got any fine brass wire?\" \"I dunno. I think they's a spool somewheres. Where d'ya think a fella could get one a them patches one-eye' fellas wear?\" \"I don' know,\" said Tom. \"Le's see if you can fin' that wire.\" In the iron shed they dug through boxes until they found the spool. Tom set the rod in a vise and carefully wrapped the wire around the piston rings, forcing them deep into their slots, and where the wire was twisted he hammered it flat; and then he turned the piston and tapped the wire all around until it cleared the piston wall. He ran his finger up and down to make sure that the rings and wire were flush with the wall. It was getting dark in the shed. The one-eyed man brought a flashlight and shone its beam on the work. \"There she is!\" said Tom. \"Say--what'll ya take for that light?\" \"Well, it ain't much good. Got fifteen cents' a new batteries. You can have her for-- oh, thirty-five cents.\" \"O.K. An' what we owe ya for this here con-rod an' piston?\" The one-eyed man rubbed his forehead with a knuckle, and a line of dirt peeled off. \"Well, sir, I jus' dunno. If the boss was here, he'd go to a parts book an' he'd find out how much is a new one, an' while you was workin', he'd be findin' out how bad you're hung up, an' how much jack ya got, an' then he'd--well, say it's eight bucks in the part book--he'd make a price a five bucks. An' if you put up a squawk, you'd get it for three. You say it's all me, but, by God, he's a son-of-a-bitch. Figgers how bad ya need it. I seen him git more for a ring gear than he give for the whole car.\" \"Yeah! But how much am I gonna give you for this here?\" \"'Bout a buck, I guess.\" \"Awright, an' I'll give ya a quarter for this here socket wrench. Make it twice as easy.\" He handed over the silver. \"Thank ya. An' cover up that goddamn eye.\" Tom and Al got into the truck. It was deep dark. Al started the motor and turned on the lights. \"So long,\" Tom called. \"See ya maybe in California.\" They turned across the highway and started back. The one-eyed man watched them go, and then he went through the iron shed to his shack behind. It was dark inside. He felt his way to the mattress on the floor, and he stretched out and cried in his bed, and the cars whizzing by on the highway only strengthened the walls of his loneliness. Tom said, \"If you'd tol' me we'd get this here thing an' get her in tonight, I'd a said you was nuts.\" \"We'll get her in awright,\" said Al. \"You got to do her, though. I'd be scared I'd get her too tight an' she'd burn out, or too loose an' she'd hammer out.\" \"I'll stick her in,\" said Tom. \"If she goes out again, she goes out. I got nothin' to lose.\" Al peered into the dusk. The lights made no impression on the gloom; but ahead, the eyes of a hunting cat flashed green in reflection of the lights. \"You sure give that fella hell,\" Al said. \"Sure did tell him where to lay down his dogs.\" \"Well, goddamn it, he was askin' for it! Jus' a pattin' hisself 'cause he got one eye, puttin' all the blame on his eye. He's a lazy, dirty son-of-a-bitch. Maybe he can snap out of it if he knowed people was wise to him.\" Al said, \"Tom, it wasn't nothin' I done burned out that bearin'.\" Tom was silent for a moment, then, \"I'm gonna take a fall outa you, Al. You jus' scrabblin' ass over tit, fear somebody gonna pin some blame on you. I know what's a matter. Young fella, all full a piss an' vinegar. Wanta be a hell of a guy all the time. But, goddamn it, Al, don' keep ya guard up when nobody ain't sparrin' with ya. You gonna be all right.\" Al did not answer him. He looked straight ahead. The truck rattled and banged over the road. A cat whipped out from the side of the road and Al swerved to hit it, but the wheels missed and the cat leaped into the grass. \"Nearly got him,\" said Al. \"Say, Tom. You heard Connie talkin' how he's gonna study nights? I been thinkin' maybe I'd study nights too. You know, radio or television or Diesel engines. Fella might get started that-a-way.\" \"Might,\" said Tom. \"Find out how much they gonna sock ya for the lessons, first. An' figger out if you're gonna study 'em. There was fellas takin' them mail lessons in McAlester. I never knowed one of 'em that finished up. Got sick of it an' left 'em slide.\" \"God Awmighty, we forgot to get somepin to eat.\" \"Well, Ma sent down plenty; preacher couldn' eat it all. Be some lef'. I wonder how long it'll take us to get to California.\" \"Christ, I don' know. Jus' plug away at her.\" They fell into silence, and the dark came and the stars were sharp and white. CASY GOT OUT of the back seat of the Dodge and strolled to the side of the road when the truck pulled up. \"I never expected you so soon,\" he said. Tom gathered the parts in the piece of sacking on the floor. \"We was lucky,\" he said. \"Got a flashlight, too. Gonna fix her right up.\" \"You forgot to take your dinner,\" said Casy. \"I'll get it when I finish. Here, Al, pull off the road a little more an' come hol' the light for me.\" He went directly to the Dodge and crawled under on his back. Al crawled under on his belly and directed the beam of the flashlight. \"Not in my eyes. There, put her up.\" Tom worked the piston up into the cylinder, twisting and turning. The brass wire caught a little on the cylinder wall. With a quick push he forced it past the rings. \"Lucky she's loose or the compression'd stop her. I think she's gonna work all right.\" \"Hope that wire don't clog the rings,\" said Al. \"Well, that's why I hammered her flat. She won't roll off. I think she'll jus' melt out an' maybe give the walls a brass plate.\" \"Think she might score the walls?\" Tom laughed. \"Jesus Christ, them walls can take it. She's drinkin' oil like a gopher hole awready. Little more ain't gonna hurt none.\" He worked the rod down over the shaft and tested the lower half. \"She'll take some shim.\" He said, \"Casy!\" \"Yeah.\" \"I'm takin' up this here bearing now. Get out to that crank an' turn her over slow when I tell ya.\" He tightened the bolts. \"Now. Over slow!\" And as the angular shaft turned, he worked the bearing against it. \"Too much shim,\" Tom said. \"Hold it, Casy.\" He took out the bolts and removed thin shims from each side and put the bolts back. \"Try her again, Casy!\" And he worked the rod again. \"She's a lit-tle bit loose yet. Wonder if she'd be too tight if I took out more shim. I'll try her.\" Again he removed the bolts and took out another pair of the thin strips. \"Now try her, Casy.\" \"That looks good,\" said Al. Tom called, \"She any harder to turn, Casy?\" \"No, I don't think so.\" \"Well, I think she's snug here. I hope to God she is. Can't hone no babbitt without tools. This here socket wrench makes her a hell of a lot easier.\" Al said, \"Boss a that yard gonna be purty mad when he looks for that size socket an' she ain't there.\" \"That's his screwin',\" said Tom. \"We didn' steal her.\" He tapped the cotter-pins in and bent the ends out. \"I think that's good. Look, Casy, you hold the light while me an' Al get this here pan up.\" Casy knelt down and took the flashlight. He kept the beam on the working hands as they patted the gasket gently in place and lined the holes with the pan bolts. The two men strained at the weight of the pan, caught the end bolts, and then set in the others; and when they were all engaged, Tom took them up little by little until the pan settled evenly in against the gasket, and he tightened hard against the nuts. \"I guess that's her,\" Tom said. He tightened the oil tap, looked carefully up at the pan, and took the light and searched the ground. \"There she is. Le's get the oil back in her.\" They crawled out and poured the bucket of oil back in the crank case. Tom inspected the gasket for leaks. \"O.K., Al. Turn her over,\" he said. Al got into the car and stepped on the starter. The motor caught with a roar. Blue smoke poured from the exhaust pipe. \"Throttle down!\" Tom shouted. \"She'll burn oil till that wire goes. Gettin' thinner now.\" And as the motor turned over, he listened carefully. \"Put up the spark an' let her idle.\" He listened again. \"O.K., Al. Turn her off. I think we done her. Where's that meat now?\" \"You make a darn good mechanic,\" Al said. \"Why not? I worked in the shop a year. We'll take her good an' slow for a couple hunderd miles. Give her a chance to work in.\" They wiped their grease-covered hands on bunches of weeds and finally rubbed them on their trousers. They fell hungrily on the boiled pork and swigged the water from the bottle. \"I liked to starved,\" said Al. \"What we gonna do now, go on to the camp?\" \"I dunno,\" said Tom. \"Maybe they'd charge us a extry half-buck. Le's go on an' talk to the folks--tell 'em we're fixed. Then if they wanta sock us extry--we'll move on. The folks'll wanta know. Jesus, I'm glad Ma stopped us this afternoon. Look around with the light, Al. See we don't leave nothin'. Get that socket wrench in. We may need her again.\" Al searched the ground with the flashlight. \"Don't see nothin'.\" \"All right. I'll drive her. You bring the truck, Al.\" Tom started the engine. The preacher got in the car. Tom moved slowly, keeping the engine at a low speed, and Al followed in the truck. He crossed the shallow ditch, crawling in low gear. Tom said, \"These here Dodges can pull a house in low gear. She's sure ratio'd down. Good thing for us--I wanta break that bearin' in easy.\" On the highway the Dodge moved along slowly. The 12-volt headlights threw a short blob of yellowish light on the pavement. Casy turned to Tom. \"Funny how you fellas can fix a car. Jus' light right in an' fix her. I couldn't fix no car, not even now when I seen you do it.\" \"Got to grow into her when you're a little kid,\" Tom said. \"It ain't jus' knowin'. It's more'n that. Kids now can tear down a car 'thout even thinkin' about it.\" A jackrabbit got caught in the lights and he bounced along ahead, cruising easily, his great ears flopping with every jump. Now and then he tried to break off the road, but the wall of darkness thrust him back. Far ahead bright headlights appeared and bore down on them. The rabbit hesitated, faltered, then turned and bolted toward the lesser lights of the Dodge. There was a small soft jolt as he went under the wheels. The oncoming car swished by. \"We sure squashed him,\" said Casy. Tom said, \"Some fellas like to hit 'em. Gives me a little shakes ever' time. Car sounds O.K. Them rings must a broke loose by now. She ain't smokin' so bad.\" \"You done a nice job,\" said Casy. A small wooden house dominated the camp ground, and on the porch of the house a gasoline lantern hissed and threw its white glare in a great circle. Half a dozen tents were pitched near the house, and cars stood beside the tents. Cooking for the night was over, but the coals of the campfires still glowed on the ground by the camping places. A group of men had gathered to the porch where the lantern burned, and their faces were strong and muscled under the harsh white light, light that threw black shadows of their hats over their foreheads and eyes and made their chins seem to jut out. They sat on the steps, and some stood on the ground, resting their elbows on the porch floor. The proprietor, a sullen lanky man, sat in a chair on the porch. He leaned back against the wall, and he drummed his fingers on his knee. Inside the house a kerosene lamp burned, but its thin light was blasted by the hissing glare of the gasoline lantern. The gathering of men surrounded the proprietor. Tom drove the Dodge to the side of the road and parked. Al drove through the gate in the truck. \"No need to take her in,\" Tom said. He got out and walked through the gate to the white glare of the lantern. The proprietor dropped his front chair legs to the floor and leaned forward. \"You men wanta camp here?\" \"No,\" said Tom. \"We got folks here. Hi, Pa.\" Pa, seated on the bottom step, said, \"Thought you was gonna be all week. Get her fixed?\" \"We was pig lucky,\" said Tom. \"Got a part 'fore dark. We can get goin' fust thing in the mornin'.\" \"That's a pretty nice thing,\" said Pa. \"Ma's worried. Ya Granma's off her chump.\" \"Yeah, Al tol' me. She any better now?\" \"Well, anyways she's a-sleepin'.\" The proprietor said, \"If you wanta pull in here an' camp it'll cost you four bits. Get a place to camp an' water an' wood. An' nobody won't bother you.\" \"What the hell,\" said Tom. \"We can sleep in the ditch right beside the road, an' it won't cost nothin'.\" The owner drummed his knee with his fingers. \"Deputy sheriff comes on by in the night. Might make it tough for ya. Got a law against sleepin' out in this State. Got a law about vagrants.\" \"If I pay you a half a dollar I ain't a vagrant, huh?\" \"That's right.\" Tom's eyes glowed angrily. \"Deputy sheriff ain't your brother-'n-law by any chance?\" The owner leaned forward. \"No, he ain't. An' the time ain't come yet when us local folks got to take no talk from you goddamn bums, neither.\" \"It don't trouble you none to take our four bits. An' when'd we get to be bums? We ain't asked ya for nothin'. All of us bums, huh? Well, we ain't askin' no nickels from you for the chance to lay down an' rest.\" The men on the porch were rigid, motionless, quiet. Expression was gone from their faces; and their eyes, in the shadows under their hats, moved secretly up to the face of the proprietor. Pa growled, \"Come off it, Tom.\" \"Sure, I'll come off it.\" The circle of men were quiet, sitting on the steps, leaning on the high porch. Their eyes glittered under the harsh light of the gas lantern. Their faces were hard in the hard light, and they were very still. Only their eyes moved from speaker to speaker, and their faces were expressionless and quiet. A lamp bug slammed into the lantern and broke itself, and fell into the darkness. In one of the tents a child wailed in complaint, and a woman's soft voice soothed it and then broke into a low song, \"Jesus loves you in the night. Sleep good, sleep good. Jesus watches in the night. Sleep, oh, sleep, oh.\" The lantern hissed on the porch. The owner scratched in the V of his open shirt, where a tangle of white chest hair showed. He was watchful and ringed with trouble. He watched the men in the circle, watched for some expression. And they made no move. Tom was silent for a long time. His dark eyes looked slowly up at the proprietor. \"I don't wanta make no trouble,\" he said. \"It's a hard thing to be named a bum. I ain't afraid,\" he said softly. \"I'll go for you an' your deputy with my mitts--here now, or jump Jesus. But there ain't no good in it.\" The men stirred, changed positions, and their glittering eyes moved slowly upward to the mouth of the proprietor, and their eyes watched for his lips to move. He was reassured. He felt that he had won, but not decisively enough to charge in. \"Ain't you got half a buck?\" he asked. \"Yeah, I got it. But I'm gonna need it. I can't set it out jus' for sleepin'.\" \"Well, we all got to make a livin'.\" \"Yeah,\" Tom said. \"On'y I wisht they was some way to make her 'thout takin' her away from somebody else.\" The men shifted again. And Pa said, \"We'll get movin' smart early. Look, mister. We paid. This here fella is part a our folks. Can't he stay? We paid.\" \"Half a dollar a car,\" said the proprietor. \"Well, he ain't got no car. Car's out in the road.\" \"He came in a car,\" said the proprietor. \"Ever'body'd leave their car out there an' come in an' use my place for nothin'.\" Tom said, \"We'll drive along the road. Meet ya in the morning. We'll watch for ya. Al can stay an' Uncle John can come with us--\" He looked at the proprietor. \"That awright with you?\" He made a quick decision, with a concession in it. \"If the same number stays that come an' paid--that's awright.\" Tom brought out his bag of tobacco, a limp gray rag by now, with a little damp tobacco dust in the bottom of it. He made a lean cigarette and tossed the bag away. \"We'll go along pretty soon,\" he said. Pa spoke generally to the circle. \"It's dirt hard for folks to tear up an' go. Folks like us that had our place. We ain't shif'less. Till we got tractored off, we was people with a farm.\" A young thin man, with eyebrows sunburned yellow, turned his head slowly. \"Croppin'?\" he asked. \"Sure we was sharecroppin'. Use' ta own the place.\" The young man faced forward again. \"Same as us,\" he said. \"Lucky for us it ain't gonna las' long,\" said Pa. \"We'll get out west an' we'll get work an' we'll get a piece a growin' land with water.\" Near the edge of the porch a ragged man stood. His black coat dripped torn streamers. The knees were gone from his dungarees. His face was black with dust, and lined where sweat had washed through. He swung his head toward Pa. \"You folks must have a nice little pot a money.\" \"No, we ain't got no money,\" Pa said. \"But they's plenty of us to work, an' we're all good men. Get good wages out there an' we'll put 'em together. We'll make out.\" The ragged man stared while Pa spoke, and then he laughed, and his laughter turned to a high whinnying giggle. The circle of faces turned to him. The giggling got out of control and turned into coughing. His eyes were red and watering when he finally controlled the spasms. \"You goin' out there--oh, Christ!\" The giggling started again. \"You goin' out an' get--good wages--oh, Christ!\" He stopped and said slyly, \"Pickin' oranges maybe? Gonna pick peaches?\" Pa's tone was dignified. \"We gonna take what they got. They got lots a stuff to work in.\" The ragged man giggled under his breath. Tom turned irritably. \"What's so goddamn funny about that?\" The ragged man shut his mouth and looked sullenly at the porch boards. \"You folks all goin' to California, I bet.\" \"I tol' you that,\" said Pa. \"You didn' guess nothin'.\" The ragged man said slowly, \"Me--I'm comin' back. I been there.\" The faces turned quickly toward him. The men were rigid. The hiss of the lantern dropped to a sigh and the proprietor lowered the front chair legs to the porch, stood up, and pumped the lantern until the hiss was sharp and high again. He went back to his chair, but he did not tilt back again. The ragged man turned toward the faces. \"I'm goin' back to starve. I ruther starve all over at oncet.\" Pa said, \"What the hell you talkin' about? I got a han'bill says they got good wages, an' little while ago I seen a thing in the paper says they need folks to pick fruit.\" The ragged man turned to Pa. \"You got any place to go, back home?\" \"No,\" said Pa. \"We're out. They put a tractor past the house.\" \"You wouldn' go back then?\" \"'Course not.\" \"Then I ain't gonna fret you,\" said the ragged man. \"'Course you ain't gonna fret me. I got a han'bill says they need men. Don't make no sense if they don't need men. Costs money for them bills. They wouldn' put 'em out if they didn' need men.\" \"I don' wanna fret you.\" Pa said angrily, \"You done some jackassin'. You ain't gonna shut up now. My han'bill says they need men. You laugh an' say they don't. Now, which one's a liar?\" The ragged man looked down into Pa's angry eyes. He looked sorry. \"Han'bill's right,\" he said. \"They need men.\" \"Then why the hell you stirrin' us up laughin'?\" \"'Cause you don't know what kind a men they need.\" \"What you talkin' about?\" The ragged man reached a decision. \"Look\", he said. \"How many men they say they want on your han'bill?\" \"Eight hunderd, an' that's in one little place.\" \"Orange color han'bill?\" \"Why--yes.\" \"Give the name a the fella--says so and so, labor contractor?\" Pa reached in his pocket and brought out the folded handbill. \"That's right. How'd you know?\" \"Look,\" said the man. \"It don't make no sense. This fella wants eight hunderd men. So he prints up five thousand of them things an' maybe twenty thousan' people sees 'em. An' maybe two-three thousan' folks gets movin' account a this here han'bill. Folks that's crazy with worry.\" \"But it don't make no sense!\" Pa cried. \"Not till you see the fella that put out this here bill. You'll see him, or somebody that's workin' for him. You'll be a-campin' by a ditch, you an' fifty other famblies. An' he'll look in your tent an' see if you got anything lef' to eat. An' if you got nothin', he says, 'Wanna job?' An' you'll say, 'I sure do, mister. I'll sure thank you for a chance to do some work.' An' he'll say, 'I can use you.' An' you'll say, 'When do I start?' An' he'll tell you where to go, an' what time, an' then he'll go on. Maybe he needs two hunderd men, so he talks to five hunderd, an' they tell other folks, an' when you get to the place, they's a thousan' men. This here fella says, 'I'm payin' twenty cents an hour.' An' maybe half a the men walk off. But they's still five hunderd that's so goddamn hungry they'll work for nothin' but biscuits. Well, this here fella's got a contract to pick them peaches or--chop that cotton. You see now? The more fellas he can get, an' the hungrier, less he's gonna pay. An' he'll get a fella with kids if he can, 'cause--hell, I says I wasn't gonna fret ya.\" The circle of faces looked coldly at him. The eyes tested his words. The ragged man grew self-conscious. \"I says I wasn't gonna fret ya, an' here I'm a-doin' it. You gonna go on. You ain't goin' back.\" The silence hung on the porch. And the light hissed, and a halo of moths swung around and around the lantern. The ragged man went on nervously, \"Lemme tell ya what to do when ya meet that fella says he got work. Lemme tell ya. Ast him what he's gonna pay. Ast him to write down what he's gonna pay. Ast him that. I tell you men you're gonna get fooled if you don't.\" The proprietor leaned forward in his chair, the better to see the ragged dirty man. He scratched among the gray hairs on his chest. He said coldly, \"You sure you ain't one of these here troublemakers? You sure you ain't a labor faker?\" And the ragged man cried, \"I swear to God I ain't!\" \"They's plenty of 'em,\" the proprietor said. \"Goin' aroun' stirrin' up trouble. Gettin' folks mad. Chiselin' in. They's plenty of 'em. Time's gonna come when we string 'em all up, all them troublemakers. We gonna run 'em outa the country. Man wants to work, O.K. If he don't--the hell with him. We ain't gonna let him stir up trouble.\" The ragged man drew himself up. \"I tried to tell you folks,\" he said. \"Somepin it took me a year to find out. Took two kids dead, took my wife dead to show me. But I can't tell you. I should of knew that. Nobody couldn't tell me, neither. I can't tell ya about them little fellas layin' in the tent with their bellies puffed out an' jus' skin on their bones, an' shiverin' an' whinin' like pups, an' me runnin' aroun' tryin' to get work--not for money, not for wages!\" he shouted. \"Jesus Christ, jus' for a cup a flour an' a spoon a lard. An' then the coroner come. 'Them children died a heart failure,' he said. Put it on his paper. Shiverin', they was, an' their bellies stuck out like a pig bladder.\" The circle was quiet, and mouths were open a little. The men breathed shallowly, and watched. The ragged man looked around at the circle, and then he turned and walked quickly away into the darkness. The dark swallowed him, but his dragging footsteps could be heard a long time after he had gone, footsteps along the road; and a car came by on the highway, and its lights showed the ragged man shuffling along the road, his head hanging down and his hands in the black coat pockets. The men were uneasy. One said, \"Well--gettin' late. Got to get to sleep.\" The proprietor said, \"Prob'ly shif'less. They's so goddamn many shif'less fellas on the road now.\" And then he was quiet. And he tipped his chair back against the wall again and fingered his throat. Tom said, \"Guess I'll go see Ma for a minute, an' then we'll shove along a piece.\" The Joad men moved away. Pa said, \"S'pose he's tellin' the truth--that fella?\" The preacher answered, \"He's tellin' the truth, awright. The truth for him. He wasn't makin' nothin' up.\" \"How about us?\" Tom demanded. \"Is that the truth for us?\" \"I don' know,\" said Casy. \"I don' know,\" said Pa. They walked to the tent, tarpaulin spread over a rope. And it was dark inside, and quiet. When they came near, a grayish mass stirred near the door and arose to person height. Ma came out to meet them. \"All sleepin',\" she said. \"Granma finally dozed off.\" Then she saw it was Tom. \"How'd you get here?\" she demanded anxiously. \"You ain't had no trouble?\" \"Got her fixed,\" said Tom. \"We're ready to go when the rest is.\" \"Thank the dear God for that,\" Ma said. \"I'm just a-twitterin' to go on. Wanta get where it's rich an' green. Wanta get there quick.\" Pa cleared his throat. \"Fella was jus' sayin'--\" Tom grabbed his arm and yanked it. \"Funny what he says,\" Tom said. \"Says they's lots a folks on the way.\" Ma peered through the darkness at them. Inside the tent Ruthie coughed and snorted in her sleep. \"I washed 'em up,\" Ma said. \"Fust water we got enough of to give 'em a goin'-over. Lef' the buckets out for you fellas to wash too. Can't keep nothin' clean on the road.\" \"Ever'body in?\" Pa asked. \"All but Connie an' Rosasharn. They went off to sleep in the open. Says it's too warm in under cover.\" Pa observed querulously, \"That Rosasharn is gettin' awful scary an' nimsy-mimsy.\" \"It's her first,\" said Ma. \"Her an' Connie sets a lot a store by it. You done the same thing.\" \"We'll go now,\" Tom said. \"Pull off the road a little piece ahead. Watch out for us ef we don't see you. Be off right-han' side.\" \"Al's stayin'?\" \"Yeah. Leave Uncle John come with us. 'Night, Ma.\" They walked away through the sleeping camp. In front of one tent a low fitful fire burned and a woman watched a kettle that cooked early breakfast. The smell of the cooking beans was strong and fine. \"Like to have a plate a them,\" Tom said politely as they went by. The woman smiled. \"They ain't done or you'd be welcome,\" she said. \"Come aroun' in the daybreak.\" \"Thank you, ma'am,\" Tom said. He and Casy and Uncle John walked by the porch. The proprietor still sat in his chair, and the lantern hissed and flared. He turned his head as the three went by. \"Ya runnin' outa gas,\" Tom said. \"Well, time to close up anyways.\" \"No more half-bucks rollin' down the road, I guess,\" Tom said. The chair legs hit the floor. \"Don't you go a-sassin' me. I 'member you. You're one of these here troublemakers.\" \"Damn right,\" said Tom. \"I'm bolshevisky.\" \"They's too damn many of you kinda guys aroun'.\" Tom laughed as they went out the gate and climbed into the Dodge. He picked up a clod and threw it at the light. They heard it hit the house and saw the proprietor spring to his feet and peer into the darkness. Tom started the car and pulled into the road. And he listened closely to the motor as it turned over, listened for knocks. The road spread dimly under the weak lights of the car.Embed",

As the sun slips the tearaway stars Into the scented scheme of night I kissed her mouth like a dark red rose Set upon a marbled dream of white So pure of thought like a Vestal statue Jewelled with a God-lent grace I was close to coming when she bid adieu Fuelled by heartache rent upon her face there  Oh Mina, obscener Thoughts obsess my days Oh Mina, obscener Thoughts possess me That I must now obey  They say the darkest hour Is that before the dawn When nothing in one's power Can dissipate the great forlorn Shadows of fire that haunt me Like risen whispers of her name For dawn is a dusk Wherein needs must Erupt from the grave, aflame  Written in the dead of night And riding on the burning wind Smitten by her read delight My words alight like leave of sin  Stepping through a mirror The princess of the emerald glass Brought me on sip nearer Love's infernal past...  They say Hell hath no furies Like a woman scorned by life When the Heavenly Judge and juries Participate to chain this wife With forced virtue, Her secret needs On warm we nights, with storm-wracked bites I gave her Eden after the flood  Written in the dead of night And riding on the burning wind Smitten by her read delight My words alight like leaves of sin Verona, Marishka, Aleera Brides of old and goddesses all Forgive my wishes to be always near her Forever or whenever seas recall  The Aphrodite from my embrace For as Mars (whom her lips placate) I tore these shores with wars of hatred Before our Paris wet his fate In Helen, one might find mistake In winning tragedy For all eternity...  I am still lovesick for Mina I am still so lovesick for MinaEmbed",

I'm just prayin' this man's lucky The only person to come (cum) from behind Rone is Sandusky You asked 'Ganik for more money, gave him all kind of quotes He flew me first class, he made you ride the coach He like, \"Bro, that's a piece of cake, that's the cheapest angle he can take.\" Well if you don't like rape jokes then stopped being raped He's like, \"Be more creative next time. My name wasn't in the headlines He never gave me red wine before bed time You're from Philly - if it wasn't Sandusky, it was Tech-9 You blew Pat in a Cadillac, why was it filmed for? His throat's still sore We saw Adam choke in (choking) the caddy; Happy Gilmore In a press conference you told Head ICE, \"I suck your dick.

I'm fuckin' fat now Plus my comeback's versus Charron, I'm doin' bad, wow I mean, wasn't I supposed to make a run off rap? TV shows, movies, dumb contracts Stand up, radio, #1 podcast Sold out concert, wait...I done all that See I don't do it for the fame like my enemy does I'll put a bone through your cheek like an elephant tusk And I don't do it for the cash cause my cheddar been up Oh, I'm just doin' this for the adrenaline rush So what's up? I know you been watchin' me walk On the sack (Sac') for 10 years like Vlade Divac Two call outs, three calls outs, I said, \"Fuck it he's unstable.\" Four call outs, five call outs, I'm gettin' up from the lunch table But first, a history lesson Your name was Triple C until you ever heard of me And then you changed it to Ch-Rone two months after I hit the scene And while that might all seem above board, Travis Imagine a battle rapper came out named \"Ch-Organik\" I would probably bother you, but I always show Buddy Love Just clumped (Klump'd) him with the rest, never let push come to shove But somehow, you turned into this little brother to me Who'd always want to compete Who'd always tug at my sleeve The bother, the little toddler, the fly buzzing at me Food stuck in my teeth, the tag under my tee The terrible combination of awkward and cocky Chronically sloppy, sonically off beat Every single day you should curse God for your body Your cringe worthy demeanor his this tailored for the perfect take down But the second hand awkwardness of sharing the stage with you made me want to turn the plate down We watched you grow up from a boy, you have a perverts face now Any character assassination would be a nervous breakdown Yo, your eye's movin', how he's quivering like it's puberty that crippled him He's a wet noodle, a drenched poodle, a drooping piece of licorice From your shoulders to your arms, how you move them like an idiot If we were judging off body language, bro you would be illiterate But his karate action arms, that's his true talent Throw him some melons while he's rappin' he'll make a fruit salad But I'm not here to make an impression of you, I'm here to make an impression on you To prove that none of your family matters, don't your uncle or auntie (anti) matter I'm unstable, I'm Billy Idol minus the Stratocaster I'll put a foreigner through the rafters, I'm the coroner for these rappers It's a champ versus a stepping stool, I'm the former you're the latter (ladder) Bro, you always wanted my chains, well today we can fulfill that You never have to win a title, I'll leave you permanently stilled champ See, I am offended at any list where your name is ranked ahead of me I am resentful of anyone that puts you in the same breath as me The only chance you'd ever be ranked ahead of me is alphabetically, so thank the letter \"C\" It's gon' be agony like you were at Gethsemane You should be banned indefinitely like Randy Gregory I'm here to get under your skin like an appendectomy or Patrick Beverley Bro you have the personality of a patch of celery You should've been an abandoned pregnancy You misunderstood your girl's Tinder bio when she said she wanted to be challenged mentally He's been chasin' me for so long, it's really got me in a whirlwind It's got me wonderin', who's really your white whale? Me? Or your little girlfriend? I mean, he think that's whore's a looker cause she look like some sorta hooker It's no wonder that he get Jersey'd as soon as Corey book her (Cory Booker) But you came a long way from Laura Tarsi We look back and still laugh You used to have a fake girlfriend, now your new one is real fat But your jokes? Stolen Concepts? Stolen Wordplay? Stolen And he thinks all of it's fine He can't go one battle without repurposing someone else's good idea, shit, probably mine So for your raps 'bout sellin' drugs to the bars that Corey still in (stealin') I might have to take a hand off since he act like Corey Dillon But you said I turned my back on battle rap, we need to stop the cap You're actin' like I robbed the culture with a gun and a stocking mask I've had battle rappers on my phone suicidal, I'm the one that they called to chat It wasn't the King Of The Dot Facebook group, I'm the one talking back I see a battle rapper down, no problem, I offer cash I had them eating off my plate, when you wouldn't offer scraps GoFundMe's, tickets, PayPerViews, no problem I'm droppin' racks I put my money where my mouth is, what's more King Of The Dot than that? Bro you could never match my moves, either in or out the ring They call me Roney Bae The Price, but to you, I'll always be the king [Round 2: Charron] Hey man, he always tellin' me my hands are out of place Philly losin' 'Back 2 Back', this is Meek Mill when he battlin' Drake He said I'm makin' fruit salad, but you dressed in purple, put the strap in his face Man I'll have this fruit on the wall; Alexander The Grape And you keep doin' a lot of gay jokes, man I don't know why y'all playin' You said my girlfriend is fat, how many times have I told you we're not datin' So Organik hit his phone up For two years he never showed up I'm not surprised he split that's what atoms (Adams) do when they blow up But, I'm not out here exposing you You already done that I'm not hurt you moved on from battling that's what your supposed to do I'm mad that once you made it, you didn't put on anyone that's close to you See, I helped Carter with Wild N' Out we trained a lot I told Ward, \"Come here if you wanna take my spot.\" If I had your platform, do you know how many names I'd drop? Once you get a Barstool you're supposed to start takin' shots A real king would've came back to start raisin' his stock You're an NFL blocker, you should know when you drop the ball the game doesn't stop You are not one of us Who was on your number one podcast? Not one of us Doesn't matter if you're GZ I'm still supportin' you Go to war with you You want me cause MTV can do more for you The midget in Joker you need a killer to open up doors for you I have more money and still do this for fun You're from Philly you should know where your Roots started from I got a bone to pick with him look what you have become On God, I'll make a bitch outta Adam; Genesis 2:21 You gotta look at me when I'm killing you  To go viral you'd change you're gender like Caitlyn Jenner you have no shame what so ever We've outgrown you Adams bitchmade from the rib cage we want the old you Do this pussy so bad if you were TI's kid he'd disown you He's like \"I'm American as shit, Honest Abe mixed with John McCain\" Well I battle rap his shit I'm bodybag mixed with Shotty/Swave, the near divorce Caustic made Tom Cruise mom's shoes we don't walk the same I'm a Lush intro with his nostrils glazed I'm the energy of Dizaster but not the braids I'm Three Of Them Thangs off the brain I'm Pat Stay when he got the chain I'm the apology you forgot to make to Cadalack Ron when you dropped his name I'm PH in his Team Homi ways I've every Bender multi schemed on a stage I'm King Of The Dot in their beat boxing days Mixed with the six people that lost their life getting crushed by T-Top on stage And in this battle he started off with, \"Battling for a decade, you're truly a disgrace If I'm battling in 2021 someone shoot me in the face.\" You've used battle rap since day one, this is where we both got our fame from If I'm battling in 2029, pat me on the back like, \"thanks for remembering where you came from.\" You got nice flow but no punching skill Ten years I'm punching still The Philly Prince Will get sonned in Cali I'm Uncle Phil Slashed throat They put his face on a shirt, \"RIP the Frat GOAT\" This time when you go viral on a tee (T) it ain't for fat jokes You handpick opportunities it's see through 'Ganik didn't even say your name and I knew it'd be you I just said I think I'll win and he wrote \"#metoo\" \"I'm your executioner, Lucifer\" shut the fuck up Your time is fading Rone, who you annihilating? You look like all five people that died from vaping You callin' out Mike P? Dawg that's light Bring him to the SMACK Killer we are not alike I'll treat him like the show you got fired from and Drop The Mic(Mike) I got a violent left; ANTIFA You getting floored this time, fuck a metaphor or rhyme The right will have him higher than our credit scores combined While you were doing keg stands grabbin' your friends erection I beat you in a freestyle battle with less aggression Listen Rone this ain't beer pong you won't get redemption The frat killer, tell Brad, Thad and Chad that this verse is amazing You can't fuck with the GOAT this ain't fraternity hazing How many IPA's have you tried today? Your parents got the job done My sweet 16: Not fun What you know 'bout asking your dad for two Mercedes and you got one? This ain't for the news fans that just want us to hold lead Code red Connor Mcgregor this for the old heads Rone you ain't nothing but a fuckin' cokehead Waitin' for someone to have a bump for him like an old thread I got all kinds of tablets I can supply this addict So much speed Al Davis tried to draft it Have him snortin' 'til he feel ill Coke so white Method Man assumed it voted for Real Deal He gon' make this Barstool vs Wild N' Out and that's a fact I mean I don't care and you claimin' I don't clap a gat Bring up Timothy De La Ghetto cause he's got the man purse, that just means my man is strapped Who from Barstool is here to support you? I mean, well that guy's wack Your friends aren't in your corner and that's a fact No matter how much you ignore this, you will always be welcomed in battle rap One day you'll be fired from your job and that's a fact Don't be surprised cause a Barstool never has your back Time!  [Round 2: Rone] Imagine being a grown man, Charron fan You talk about Bodied like it's Rocky, the delusion is astounding It's budget was $15,000,000 and it grossed $100,000 And you had what? Two more lines than me? Shit ain't never been funny Congratulations, you had a bigger part in losing Eminem's money But while we were shooting Bodied you were drinkin' in the lobby In the Standard in Los Angeles, you were gettin' sloppy You started mouthing off to Pat Stay I thought, \"This won't go well.\" And sure enough, he bitch slapped you in front of the whole hotel And I don't wanna misconstrue it, you got slapped and your lip was drooling You would've thought that he dropped this fruit from the way that this bitch was bruising That's why we laugh when you talk tough like, \"Who does he think he's fooling?\" You almost died off that smack in an L.A. hotel we would've thought it was Whitney Houston You were a terrible drunk and he smacked you in the Standard So K-Shine's not an outlier, smacking you is the standard I mean Aye Verb stepped to you, Shotgun peppered you Bonnie almost broke her fuckin' wrist dick checkin' you Shine made a mess of you, Pat disrespected you Ars' had his hands on your face like he was blessin' you So who the fuck are you playin' with? You've already been 86'd I don't mean they cancelled you, I mean number of hands on you if they dusted your face for prints Why does that always happen to you? Why does that never happen to me? It's not happenstance that they slot you fam', that's just who you happen to be But you embrace the school shooter image like you think that shit is powerful 'Til I lift you up and beat the fucking warning signs outta you Bro this one's a camcorder, it'll help deliver the picture This one's a transformer it'll turn him into a sprinter Your dad's a mechanic from Orleans, well I had to have a talk with him It's funny he works at Midas, and you got a touch of Autism But you take pride in Wild N' Out when it's legitimately terrible 15 straight years of the same Mariah Carey joke Word to Nick Cannon's turban, I've been offered Wild N' Out six times, there's written record of that Six times, ain't that the amount of seasons that you've been in the cast? Bro, from Wild N' Out to Drop The Mic to battles in this league They'll only ever call you when they can't book me The name brand versus the budget version Undeserving, less funny person The first choice that they cater too versus the back up, the safety school The option is less sexy when they can't sign Gretzky The Chrysler 300 they rent when they can't afford the Bentley Bro, all of Viacom loves me, they would kill to write a check They'd have a pilot waitin' on me like a fuckin' private jet Yo, you sound like you're high on helium, the show is the height of tedium This skinny little geek is tryin' to make it on TV, that's a dying medium But before I retire his ass like Andrew Luck Let's talk about that time Organik watched some groupie bitch and you fuck You went soft but tried to keep going cause the audience had you rattled Isn't it bad enough he had to watch you pretend to be hard in your battles? Bro, you love to go on SMACK to brag on the fake crack you slang And gats you bang If it were up to you, you'd be on a Banned (band) every month like Andrew Yang But what about that time you said, \"Mexicans can't be super heroes\" cause quote \"They're too lazy bro\" But what's really lazy though? The accent? The basic quotes The fact that you were hitting a Dominican with racist tropes that aren't even creative jokes? I mean, Corey Charron, hates the Mexicans more than the Border Patrol He's not callin' shots, he's callin' cops to a foreigner's home He'll cock his gun he hears someone say \"senor\" on the phone Well the coroner's home, put four in his dome Get beat to death, leave the flesh around your cornea swole This an orchestra, what you pen is boring and slow Past your expiration date, baby wait your formula's old You go the wrong way at every single fork in the road I'll leave your body stretched out like the warrior pose Out of all of battle rap, I got the corniest clone You hate Mexicans? Then get the fuck out California bro! Bro, I'm a mix of Rambo and Tony Soprano I'll tag your man's toe like I was Virgil Abloh You're off white thinking you got the best answer Unless there's something you want to get off your chest after like breast cancer Cause at the negotiating table, you're softer than Ned Flanders You're not scoring, Travi$ Scott's Jordan's your check's backwards Bro you said- I got a million ways kill him, but if none of all that work I'll just drop him off in east Oakland in his confederate flag shirt Bro you could never match my moves in or out the ring Call me Roney Bae The Prince but to you I'll always be the king  [Round 3: Charron] He callin' me racist but... They say \"Head ICE robbed you\", your third round was light \"If you couldn't make it out of Harlem how did my dad make it out of Harlem?\" Because he's white Like, was that a third round or a Third Reich? I'm no B. Dot, I'm not an expert on this situation And this coming from someone that accused B.E.T. of discrimination But between your dad and Head ICE, who struggled in life more? You said, \"It's not your fault if your born poor but it is if you die poor.\" That's what your physicist dad taught you while he set up your trust fund? Due to his skin, which Harlem cops did he run from? Which neighborhoods, which schools was he shunned from? That mentality is the same reason that Trump won You said, my dad was racist about the Mexicans, but c'mon son It's not your fault if you're born to a racist but it is if you become one Also, against Head ICE you also said, \"You're tethered to an existence that doesn't mean shit to me While I was taking trips to Sicily You were in self imposed poverty figuring out what kid to feed\" Cringe The epitome You act black, now look inwardly (N-wordly) Predatory lending, they couldn't get help yet They were designated to hoods they couldn't get out yet This motherfucker thought \"redlining\" was a Microsoft spell check Only people on 4chan like how you rap Your favorite chore is laundry day, so you can separate the whites from the blacks You spit those bars in Toronto in front of a bunch of crackers I dare you to come to Cali and say All Lives fucking Matter You know how many Trump supporters are here? One: Dizaster Aye, I did wear the confederate flag sleeve I accept all the scrutiny I acted foolishly Apologize- I didn't know the history and apologized to the community We move as a unit Why? Because of unity Yesterday I was called out for appropriation, today you won't hear an \"Ooops\" from me This ain't even a battle, this is a eulogy That's why shhh Rone, cause when I look at you it's a moment of silence for who I used to be You brag about your vaca's like \"Look at my big trips.\" You make 100K, you think MTV is how I get rich? Air B&B, HVAC that's the right business You get Bud Light I sip Cris' Knock over his Barstool, you ain't Wild N' Out like this bitch Last year 700K those are my digits You'd have to save up 7 years pay to get my interest Two apps, get paid when the site gets hits I inspire kids with Autism plus my girl has nice big tits Listen Rone I ain't the one to talk that \"I'm winning at life\" shit with You tried to stunt on Head ICE, dawg relax Bring up my Autism I have retarded stacks If I wake up feeling like a million bucks the market crashed A millionaire at 25 how can the prince be proud? After this quick beat down You can battle my pockets and spit your Big T rounds I don't watch Barstool I put that on the Bible I'd rather swallow crack before my Morgan's piano recital Or watch another Chilla/Trevor rematch for the title You got at The Saurus for gambling, you bet on sports games all the time So I made my own odds on the ways that you'll die A trillion to one? You died from your fans getting trampled in the streets 1,000 to 1? You OD'd after your motherfuckin' panics increased 10 to 1? You'll develop AIDS from Sandusky's beef Or 1 to 1: You die of shame after admitting you got raped once this battle's released This is karma for all your rounds I mean, you're not Big T fat, but you put on some pounds You quit battling for a podcast you're basically Okwerdz now You only hit up Ganik when he's got something to offer you You look like a bird and flock like a vulture Your dad's a physicist and he need you \"Adam\" (atom) cause you make up everything that's wrong with this culture So fuck your mother, fuck your brother I hope your step mom dies Fuck every Ben Shapiro speech on your desktop drive Fuck Barstools segments on \"The Best Pop Flies\" You make podcasts for white kids that drop the N bomb on X-Box Live Fuck you for not knowing what your privilege does Fuck the Barstool founder for calling all women \"Sluts\" Fuck you for laughing at it with your buds Fuck you for promoting a rape culture that you're a victim of Fuck Joseph Kahn for giving you a pity role and 100's of bucks After you got rejected for the role of Adam cause you weren't funny enough Fuck your character in Bodied you wouldn't engage to a thing How can you propose? For two years you stayed away from the ring Fuck your for not leading as an example Fuck you for not giving a shot to those trapped in your shadow You're from Philly, so fuck you for the last two Cassidy battles Fuck you for thinking King Of The Dot isn't the place for you Fuck you for only showing up to a SMACK event, look what you made me do And fuck the URL for last night when they hacked our PPV! I mean, people wanna go against Rone but watch how I rhyme first He wants to do this he's diggin' up dirt Well watch how he goes in his guy's hearse He says I hate Spanish people, I mean is that how your mind works?

I give a fuck if you're Autistic That shit is retarded Bro, scamming the senile, old folks losing their memory The irony, you taking advantage of people who aren't all there mentally Well I bet you wish you were back selling gas facing the elderly instead of me Cause I'll give you the option that you didn't Let's see if you keep that same energy Yo I'll get your girlfriend dog, when she comes through the east Bay And I'll pay Michael Vick to abuse it each day I'll bring it right up in her room, if she refuse the BJ I'll beat it right in front of her like Louis C.K See it could get real eventful if I use the steel against you You catch six from the tre (tray), that's a Philly special I'll Philly Pretzel Billy Pistolz, he'll be lookin' like Whoopi's braids But if I really pistol Billy Pistolz he'll be lookin' like Billy Mays So you're saying that Autism shit's real though? Oow that's mean Bet you wish you listened to Hollow and skipped the flu vaccine But I love my people with Autism unconditionally, best believe it But for you to bring it up in a title match for sympathy and expect other people not to talk about it, almost seems like you're askin' for special treatment See I'm here to dig a hole for you, soul remove and lower you And just cause you have Autism don't mean I'll take it slow for you I'll whip your ass like anyone else Cause that's what I'm supposed to do But it's a shame you don't understand social queues cause you have no idea how bad I'm owning you I've read up on non-verbal learning disorder as some insight on your brain for me It said you can read a civil war book, remember every general's name but not realize it's about slavery And that explained to me why your concepts can't hit and each angle's a bad miss Because other than General Lee (generally) you really don't understand shit I kept reading, and I almost felt bad for the geek But the deeper I got, what did I happen to see? It helps you focus on a task, you are the man with your frees It helps you access rhymes, you are fast on your feet You're less likely to be insulted that helps you battle with ease It compartmentalizes thoughts, all your facts and your schemes So by the time I finished reading I was mad as can be Until I realized the one that's really disadvantaged...is me I mean, do you know how hard it is to be a battle rapper Without Autism? Who's done a drug, a beer, who's really got bitches? I started scheming, vaccineing, you don't know how bad I want the shit The more I'm reading, I can't believe it, it's like everybody's got the shit Fucking Steve Jobs, Dickenson, Einstein, Newton, Bill Gates, Burton, Mozart, Darwin And wouldn't it be crazy if someone like Jobs went on stage with a sob story instead of making the iPod? If Einstein was \"woe is me\" instead of finding Relativity If Newton never understood his own gift's gravity? If Mozart never played strings and curled up in a ball If Darwin had played the victim and had never evolved See that's my problem with your scamming shit It isn't moralism It doesn't matter how rich you are if you're still making poor decisions You're a scumbag from your actions, no one's exploiting you Being Autistic doesn't make you any less of a man, dawg, but your choices do See I'm up front, you're sidewinding I'm a lone wolf, you're hive minded I'm obsessed with originality, you're the most derivative on the battle scene You have the charm of Rush Limbaugh, women love me, you make their skin crawl I'm good at everything, you find your second talent then show me You're a punk bitch, fuck stick, one trick pony And those that pay attention are never gon' respect him It has nothing to do with Autism we're just on different ends of the spectrum And he could never match my moves either in or out the ring They call me Roney Bae The Prince but to you I'll always be the king!Embed",

        "A Star Is Born Lyrics(spoken) March 12th, 1954 Hollywood, USA, is in an uproar  (sung) What's the cause of the wild commotion in Starland? Is it merely another tantrum by Garland? Is it Beverly Tyler's return to the screen? Or the beguine begun by Nan McFarland?  There's a rumor that the exciting event is Warner Brothers' reissuing Nora Prentiss Maybe Crawford and Stanwyck have launched a new drive To try and revive the loves of Martha Ivers, Thelma Jordan, Mildred Pierce, and Harriet Craig All these rumours are vague and untrue Then what's the hullabaloo?  It's not the revelations of Garbo laying her soul bare Telling of her extreme affection for Colbert Nor is it the discovery that Elizabeth Scott really is not a girl Then why is Movieland in a whirl?

        "Darkwater (Chap. 5) Lyrics\"The Servant In The House\"  The lady looked at me severely; I glanced away. I had addressed the little audience at some length on the disfranchisement of my people in society, politics, and industry and had studiously avoided the while her cold, green eye. I finished and shook weary hands, while she lay in wait. I knew what was coming and braced my soul.  \"Do you know where I can get a good colored cook?\" she asked. I disclaimed all guilty concupiscence. She came nearer and spitefully shook a finger in my face.  \"Why--won't--Negroes--work!\" she panted. \"I have given money for years to Hampton and Tuskegee and yet I can't get decent servants. They won't try. They're lazy! They're unreliable! They're impudent and they leave without notice. They all want to be lawyers and doctors and\" (she spat the word in venom) \"ladies!\"  \"God forbid!\" I answered solemnly, and then being of gentle birth, and unminded to strike a defenseless female of uncertain years, I ran; I ran home and wrote a chapter in my book and this is it.  I speak and speak bitterly as a servant and a servant's son, for my mother spent five or more years of her life as a menial; my father's family escaped, although grandfather as a boat steward had to fight hard to be a man and not a lackey. He fought and won. My mother's folk, however, during my childhood, sat poised on that thin edge between the farmer and the menial. The surrounding Irish had two chances, the factory and the kitchen, and most of them took the factory, with all its dirt and noise and low wage. The factory was closed to us. Our little lands were too small to feed most of us. A few clung almost sullenly to the old homes, low and red things crouching on a wide level; but the children stirred restlessly and walked often to town and saw its wonders. Slowly they dribbled off,--a waiter here, a cook there, help for a few weeks in Mrs. Blank's kitchen when she had summer boarders.  Instinctively I hated such work from my birth. I loathed it and shrank from it. Why? I could not have said. Had I been born in Carolina instead of Massachusetts I should hardly have escaped the taint of \"service.\" Its temptations in wage and comfort would soon have answered my scruples; and yet I am sure I would have fought long even in Carolina, for I knew in my heart that thither lay Hell.  I mowed lawns on contract, did \"chores\" that left me my own man, sold papers, and peddled tea--anything to escape the shadow of the awful thing that lurked to grip my soul. Once, and once only, I felt the sting of its talons. I was twenty and had graduated from Fisk with a scholarship for Harvard; I needed, however, travel money and clothes and a bit to live on until the scholarship was due. Fortson was a fellow-student in winter and a waiter in summer. He proposed that the Glee Club Quartet of Fisk spend the summer at the hotel in Minnesota where he worked and that I go along as \"Business Manager\" to arrange for engagements on the journey back. We were all eager, but we knew nothing of table-waiting. \"Never mind,\" said Fortson, \"you can stand around the dining-room during meals and carry out the big wooden trays of dirty dishes. Thus you can pick up knowledge of waiting and earn good tips and get free board.\" I listened askance, but I went.  I entered that broad and blatant hotel at Lake Minnetonka with distinct forebodings. The flamboyant architecture, the great verandas, rich furniture, and richer dresses awed us mightily. The long loft reserved for us, with its clean little cots, was reassuring; the work was not difficult,--but the meals! There were no meals. At first, before the guests ate, a dirty table in the kitchen was hastily strewn with uneatable scraps. We novices were the only ones who came to eat, while the guests' dining-room, with its savors and sights, set our appetites on edge! After a while even the pretense of meals for us was dropped. We were sure we were going to starve when Dug, one of us, made a startling discovery: the waiters stole their food and they stole the best. We gulped and hesitated. Then we stole, too, (or, at least, they stole and I shared) and we all fattened, for the dainties were marvelous. You slipped a bit here and hid it there; you cut off extra portions and gave false orders; you dashed off into darkness and hid in corners and ate and ate! It was nasty business. I hated it. I was too cowardly to steal much myself, and not coward enough to refuse what others stole.  Our work was easy, but insipid. We stood about and watched overdressed people gorge. For the most part we were treated like furniture and were supposed to act the wooden part. I watched the waiters even more than the guests. I saw that it paid to amuse and to cringe. One particular black man set me crazy. He was intelligent and deft, but one day I caught sight of his face as he served a crowd of men; he was playing the clown,--crouching, grinning, assuming a broad dialect when he usually spoke good English--ah! it was a heartbreaking sight, and he made more money than any waiter in the dining-room.  I did not mind the actual work or the kind of work, but it was the dishonesty and deception, the flattery and cajolery, the unnatural assumption that worker and diner had no common humanity. It was uncanny. It was inherently and fundamentally wrong. I stood staring and thinking, while the other boys hustled about. Then I noticed one fat hog, feeding at a heavily gilded trough, who could not find his waiter. He beckoned me. It was not his voice, for his mouth was too full. It was his way, his air, his assumption. Thus Caesar ordered his legionaries or Cleopatra her slaves. Dogs recognized the gesture. I did not. He may be beckoning yet for all I know, for something froze within me. I did not look his way again. Then and there I disowned menial service for me and my people.  I would work my hands off for an honest wage, but for \"tips\" and \"hand-me-outs,\" never! Fortson was a pious, honest fellow, who regarded \"tips\" as in the nature of things, being to the manner born; but the hotel that summer in other respects rather astonished even him. He came to us much flurried one night and got us to help him with a memorial to the absentee proprietor, telling of the wild and gay doings of midnights in the rooms and corridors among \"tired\" business men and their prostitutes. We listened wide-eyed and eager and wrote the filth out manfully. The proprietor did not thank Fortson. He did not even answer the letter.  When I finally walked out of that hotel and out of menial service forever, I felt as though, in a field of flowers, my nose had been held unpleasantly long to the worms and manure at their roots. \"Cursed be Canaan!\" cried the Hebrew priests. \"A servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.\" With what characteristic complacency did the slaveholders assume that Canaanites were Negroes and their \"brethren\" white? Are not Negroes servants? Ergo! Upon such spiritual myths was the anachronism of American slavery built, and this was the degradation that once made menial servants the aristocrats among colored folk. House servants secured some decencies of food and clothing and shelter; they could more easily reach their master's ear; their personal abilities of character became known and bonds grew between slave and master which strengthened from friendship to love, from mutual service to mutual blood.  Naturally out of this the West Indian servant climbed out of slavery into citizenship, for few West Indian masters--fewer Spanish or Dutch--were callous enough to sell their own children into slavery. Not so with English and Americans. With a harshness and indecency seldom paralleled in the civilized world white masters on the mainland sold their mulatto children, half-brothers and half-sisters, and their own wives in all but name, into life-slavery by the hundreds and thousands. They originated a special branch of slave-trading for this trade and the white aristocrats of Virginia and the Carolinas made more money by this business during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries than in any other way.  The clang of the door of opportunity thus knelled in the ears of the colored house servant whirled the whole face of Negro advancement as on some great pivot. The movement was slow, but vast. When emancipation came, before and after 1863, the house servant still held advantages. He had whatever education the race possessed and his white father, no longer able to sell him, often helped him with land and protection. Notwithstanding this the lure of house service for the Negro was gone. The path of salvation for the emancipated host of black folk lay no longer through the kitchen door, with its wide hall and pillared veranda and flowered yard beyond. It lay, as every Negro soon knew and knows, in escape from menial serfdom.  In 1860, 98 per cent of the Negroes were servants and serfs. In 1880, 30 per cent were servants and 65 per cent were serfs. The percentage of servants then rose slightly and fell again until 21 per cent were in service in 1910 and, doubtless, much less than 20 per cent today. This is the measure of our rise, but the Negro will not approach freedom until this hateful badge of slavery and mediaevalism has been reduced to less than 10 per cent.  Not only are less than a fifth of our workers servants today, but the character of their service has been changed. The million menial workers among us include 300,000 upper servants,--skilled men and women of character, like hotel waiters, Pullman porters, janitors, and cooks, who, had they been white, could have called on the great labor movement to lift their work out of slavery, to standardize their hours, to define their duties, and to substitute a living, regular wage for personal largess in the shape of tips, old clothes, and cold leavings of food. But the labor movement turned their backs on those black men when the white world dinned in their ears. Negroes are servants; servants are Negroes. They shut the door of escape to factory and trade in their fellows' faces and battened down the hatches, lest the 300,000 should be workers equal in pay and consideration with white men.  But, if the upper servants could not escape to modern, industrial conditions, how much the more did they press down on the bodies and souls of 700,000 washerwomen and household drudges,--ignorant, unskilled offal of a millionaire industrial system. Their pay was the lowest and their hours the longest of all workers. The personal degradation of their work is so great that any white man of decency would rather cut his daughter's throat than let her grow up to such a destiny. There is throughout the world and in all races no greater source of prostitution than this grade of menial service, and the Negro race in America has largely escaped this destiny simply because its innate decency leads black women to choose irregular and temporary sexual relations with men they like rather than to sell themselves to strangers. To such sexual morals is added (in the nature of self-defense) that revolt against unjust labor conditions which expresses itself in \"soldiering,\" sullenness, petty pilfering, unreliability, and fast and fruitless changes of masters.  Indeed, here among American Negroes we have exemplified the last and worst refuge of industrial caste. Menial service is an anachronism,--the refuse of mediaeval barbarism. Whey, then, does it linger? Why are we silent about it? Why in the minds of so many decent and up-seeing folks does the whole Negro problem resolve itself into the matter of their getting a cook or a maid?  No one knows better than I the capabilities of a system of domestic service at its best. I have seen children who were spiritual sons and daughters of their masters, girls who were friends of their mistresses, and old servants honored and revered. But in every such case the Servant had transcended the Menial, the Service had been exalted above the Wage. Now to accomplish this permanently and universally, calls for the same revolution in household help as in factory help and public service. While organized industry has been slowly making its help into self-respecting, well-paid men, and while public service is beginning to call for the highest types of educated and efficient thinkers, domestic service lags behind and insists upon seeking to evolve the best types of men from the worst conditions.  The cause of this perversity, to my mind, is twofold. First, the ancient high estate of Service, now pitifully fallen, yet gasping for breath; secondly, the present low estate of the outcasts of the world, peering with blood-shot eyes at the gates of the industrial heaven.  The Master spoke no greater word than that which said: \"Whosoever will be great among you, let him be your servant!\" What is greater than Personal Service! Surely no social service, no wholesale helping of masses of men can exist which does not find its effectiveness and beauty in the personal aid of man to man. It is the purest and holiest of duties. Some mighty glimmer of this truth survived in those who made the First Gentlemen of the Bedchamber, the Keepers of the Robes, and the Knights of the Bath, the highest nobility that hedged an anointed king. Nor does it differ today in what the mother does for the child or the daughter for the mother, in all the personal attentions in the old-fashioned home; this is Service! Think of what Friend has meant, not simply in spiritual sympathies, but in physical helpfulness. In the world today what calls for more of love, sympathy, learning, sacrifice, and long-suffering than the care of children, the preparation of food, the cleansing and ordering of the home, personal attendance and companionship, the care of bodies and their raiment--what greater, more intimate, more holy Services are there than these?  And yet we are degrading these services and loathing them and scoffing at them and spitting upon them, first, by turning them over to the lowest and least competent and worst trained classes in the world, and then by yelling like spoiled children if our babies are neglected, our biscuits sodden, our homes dirty, and our baths unpoured. Let one suggest that the only cure for such deeds is in the uplift of the doer and our rage is even worse and less explicable. We will call them by their first names, thus blaspheming a holy intimacy; we will confine them to back doors; we will insist that their meals be no gracious ceremony nor even a restful sprawl, but usually a hasty, heckled gulp amid garbage; we exact, not a natural, but a purchased deference, and we leave them naked to insult by our children and by our husbands.  I remember a girl,--how pretty she was, with the crimson flooding the old ivory of her cheeks and her gracious plumpness! She had come to the valley during the summer to \"do housework.\" I met and walked home with her, in the thrilling shadows, to an old village home I knew well; then as I turned to leave I learned that she was there alone in that house for a week-end with only one young white man to represent the family. Oh, he was doubtless a \"gentleman\" and all that, but for the first time in my life I saw what a snare the fowler was spreading at the feet of the daughters of my people, baited by church and state.  Not alone is the hurt thus offered to the lowly,--Society and Science suffer. The unit which we seek to make the center of society,--the Home--is deprived of the help of scientific invention and suggestion. It is only slowly and by the utmost effort that some small foothold has been gained for the vacuum cleaner, the washing-machine, the power tool, and the chemical reagent. In our frantic effort to preserve the last vestiges of slavery and mediaevalism we not only set out faces against such improvements, but we seek to use education and the power of the state to train the servants who do not naturally appear. Meantime the wild rush from house service, on the part of all who can scramble or run, continues. The rules of the labor union are designed, not simply to raise wages, but to guard against any likeness between artisan and servant. There is no essential difference in ability and training between a subway guard and a Pullman porter, but between their union cards lies a whole world.  Yet we are silent. Menial service is not a \"social problem.\" It is not really discussed. There is no scientific program for its \"reform.\" There is but one panacea: Escape! Get yourselves and your sons and daughters out of the shadow of this awful thing! Hire servants, but never be one. Indeed, subtly but surely the ability to hire at least \"a maid\" is still civilization's patent to respectability, while \"a man\" is the first word of aristocracy.  All this is because we still consciously and unconsciously hold to the \"manure\" theory of social organization. We believe that at the bottom of organized human life there are necessary duties and services which no real human being ought to be compelled to do. We push below this mudsill the derelicts and half-men, whom we hate and despise, and seek to build above it--Democracy! On such foundations is reared a Theory of Exclusiveness, a feeling that the world progresses by a process of excluding from the benefits of culture the majority of men, so that a gifted minority may blossom. Through this door the modern democrat arrives to the place where he is willing to allot two able-bodied men and two fine horses to the task of helping one wizened beldam to take the morning air.  Here the absurdity ends. Here all honest minds turn back and ask: Is menial service permanent or necessary? Can we not transfer cooking from the home to the scientific laboratory, along with the laundry? Cannot machinery, in the hands of self-respecting and well-paid artisans, do our cleaning, sewing, moving, and decorating? Cannot the training of children become an even greater profession than the attending of the sick? And cannot personal service and companionship be coupled with friendship and love where it belongs and whence it can never be divorced without degradation and pain?  In fine, can we not, black and white, rich and poor, look forward to a world of Service without Servants?  A miracle! you say? True. And only to be performed by the Immortal Child.  Jesus Christ in Texas  It was in Waco, Texas.  The convict guard laughed. \"I don't know,\" he said, \"I hadn't thought of that.\" He hesitated and looked at the stranger curiously. In the solemn twilight he got an impression of unusual height and soft, dark eyes. \"Curious sort of acquaintance for the colonel,\" he thought; then he continued aloud: \"But that nigger there is bad, a born thief, and ought to be sent up for life; got ten years last time--\"  Here the voice of the promoter, talking within, broke in; he was bending over his figures, sitting by the colonel. He was slight, with a sharp nose.  \"The convicts,\" he said, \"would cost us $96 a year and board. Well, we can squeeze this so that it won't be over $125 apiece. Now if these fellows are driven, they can build this line within twelve months. It will be running by next April. Freights will fall fifty per cent. Why, man, you'll be a millionaire in less than ten years.\"  The colonel started. He was a thick, short man, with a clean-shaven face and a certain air of breeding about the lines of his countenance; the word millionaire sounded well to his ears. He thought--he thought a great deal; he almost heard the puff of the fearfully costly automobile that was coming up the road, and he said:  \"I suppose we might as well hire them.\" \"Of course,\" answered the promoter.  The voice of the tall stranger in the corner broke in here:  \"It will be a good thing for them?\" he said, half in question.  The colonel moved. \"The guard makes strange friends,\" he thought to himself. \"What's this man doing here, anyway?\" He looked at him, or rather looked at his eyes, and then somehow he felt a warming toward him. He said:  \"Well, at least, it can't harm them; they're beyond that.\"  \"It will do them good, then,\" said the stranger again.  The promoter shrugged his shoulders. \"It will do us good,\" he said.  But the colonel shook his head impatiently. He felt a desire to justify himself before those eyes, and he answered: \"Yes, it will do them good; or at any rate it won't make them any worse than they are.\" Then he started to say something else, but here sure enough the sound of the automobile breathing at the gate stopped him and they all arose.  \"It is settled, then,\" said the promoter.  \"Yes,\" said the colonel, turning toward the stranger again. \"Are you going into town?\" he asked with the Southern courtesy of white men to white men in a country town. The stranger said he was. \"Then come along in my machine. I want to talk with you about this.\"  They went out to the car. The stranger as he went turned again to look back at the convict. He was a tall, powerfully built black fellow. His face was sullen, with a low forehead, thick, hanging lips, and bitter eyes. There was revolt written about his mouth despite the hang-dog expression. He stood bending over his pile of stones, pounding listlessly. Beside him stood a boy of twelve,--yellow, with a hunted, crafty look. The convict raised his eyes and they met the eyes of the stranger. The hammer fell from his hands.  The stranger turned slowly toward the automobile and the colonel introduced him. He had not exactly caught his name, but he mumbled something as he presented him to his wife and little girl, who were waiting.  As they whirled away the colonel started to talk, but the stranger had taken the little girl into his lap and together they conversed in low tones all the way home.  In some way, they did not exactly know how, they got the impression that the man was a teacher and, of course, he must be a foreigner. The long, cloak-like coat told this. They rode in the twilight through the lighted town and at last drew up before the colonel's mansion, with its ghost-like pillars.  The lady in the back seat was thinking of the guests she had invited to dinner and was wondering if she ought not to ask this man to stay. He seemed cultured and she supposed he was some acquaintance of the colonel's. It would be rather interesting to have him there, with the judge's wife and daughter and the rector. She spoke almost before she thought:  \"You will enter and rest awhile?\"  The colonel and the little girl insisted. For a moment the stranger seemed about to refuse. He said he had some business for his father, about town. Then for the child's sake he consented.  Up the steps they went and into the dark parlor where they sat and talked a long time. It was a curious conversation. Afterwards they did not remember exactly what was said and yet they all remembered a certain strange satisfaction in that long, low talk.  Finally the nurse came for the reluctant child and the hostess bethought herself:  \"We will have a cup of tea; you will be dry and tired.\"  She rang and switched on a blaze of light. With one accord they all looked at the stranger, for they had hardly seen him well in the glooming twilight. The woman started in amazement and the colonel half rose in anger. Why, the man was a mulatto, surely; even if he did not own the Negro blood, their practised eyes knew it. He was tall and straight and the coat looked like a Jewish gabardine. His hair hung in close curls far down the sides of his face and his face was olive, even yellow.  A peremptory order rose to the colonel's lips and froze there as he caught the stranger's eyes. Those eyes,--where had he seen those eyes before? He remembered them long years ago. The soft, tear-filled eyes of a brown girl. He remembered many things, and his face grew drawn and white. Those eyes kept burning into him, even when they were turned half away toward the staircase, where the white figure of the child hovered with her nurse and waved good-night. The lady sank into her chair and thought: \"What will the judge's wife say? How did the colonel come to invite this man here? How shall we be rid of him?\" She looked at the colonel in reproachful consternation.  Just then the door opened and the old butler came in. He was an ancient black man, with tufted white hair, and he held before him a large, silver tray filled with a china tea service. The stranger rose slowly and stretched forth his hands as if to bless the viands. The old man paused in bewilderment, tottered, and then with sudden gladness in his eyes dropped to his knees, and the tray crashed to the floor.  \"My Lord and my God!\" he whispered; but the woman screamed: \"Mother's china!\"  The doorbell rang.  \"Heavens! here is the dinner party!\" exclaimed the lady. She turned toward the door, but there in the hall, clad in her night clothes, was the little girl. She had stolen down the stairs to see the stranger again, and the nurse above was calling in vain. The woman felt hysterical and scolded at the nurse, but the stranger had stretched out his arms and with a glad cry the child nestled in them. They caught some words about the \"Kingdom of Heaven\" as he slowly mounted the stairs with his little, white burden.  The mother was glad of anything to get rid of the interloper, even for a moment. The bell rang again and she hastened toward the door, which the loitering black maid was just opening. She did not notice the shadow of the stranger as he came slowly down the stairs and paused by the newel post, dark and silent.  The judge's wife came in. She was an old woman, frilled and powdered into a semblance of youth, and gorgeously gowned. She came forward, smiling with extended hands, but when she was opposite the stranger, somewhere a chill seemed to strike her and she shuddered and cried:  \"What a draft!\" as she drew a silken shawl about her and shook hands cordially; she forgot to ask who the stranger was. The judge strode in unseeing, thinking of a puzzling case of theft.  \"Eh? What? Oh--er--yes,--good evening,\" he said, \"good evening.\" Behind them came a young woman in the glory of youth, and daintily silked, beautiful in face and form, with diamonds around her fair neck. She came in lightly, but stopped with a little gasp; then she laughed gaily and said:  \"Why, I beg your pardon. Was it not curious? I thought I saw there behind your man\"--she hesitated, but he must be a servant, she argued--\"the shadow of great, white wings. It was but the light on the drapery. What a turn it gave me.\" And she smiled again. With her came a tall, handsome, young naval officer. Hearing his lady refer to the servant, he hardly looked at him, but held his gilded cap carelessly toward him, and the stranger placed it carefully on the rack.  Last came the rector, a man of forty, and well-clothed. He started to pass the stranger, stopped, and looked at him inquiringly.  \"I beg your pardon,\" he said. \"I beg your pardon,--I think I have met you?\"  The stranger made no answer, and the hostess nervously hurried the guests on. But the rector lingered and looked perplexed.  \"Surely, I know you. I have met you somewhere,\" he said, putting his hand vaguely to his head. \"You--you remember me, do you not?\"  The stranger quietly swept his cloak aside, and to the hostess' unspeakable relief passed out of the door.  \"I never knew you,\" he said in low tones as he went.  The lady murmured some vain excuse about intruders, but the rector stood with annoyance written on his face.  \"I beg a thousand pardons,\" he said to the hostess absently. \"It is a great pleasure to be here,--somehow I thought I knew that man. I am sure I knew him once.\"  The stranger had passed down the steps, and as he passed, the nurse, lingering at the top of the staircase, flew down after him, caught his cloak, trembled, hesitated, and then kneeled in the dust.  He touched her lightly with his hand and said: \"Go, and sin no more!\"  With a glad cry the maid left the house, with its open door, and turned north, running. The stranger turned eastward into the night. As they parted a long, low howl rose tremulously and reverberated through the night. The colonel's wife within shuddered.  \"The bloodhounds!\" she said.  The rector answered carelessly:  \"Another one of those convicts escaped, I suppose. Really, they need severer measures.\" Then he stopped. He was trying to remember that stranger's name.  The judge's wife looked about for the draft and arranged her shawl. The girl glanced at the white drapery in the hall, but the young officer was bending over her and the fires of life burned in her veins.  Howl after howl rose in the night, swelled, and died away. The stranger strode rapidly along the highway and out into the deep forest. There he paused and stood waiting, tall and still.  A mile up the road behind a man was running, tall and powerful and black, with crime-stained face and convicts' stripes upon him, and shackles on his legs. He ran and jumped, in little, short steps, and his chains rang. He fell and rose again, while the howl of the hounds rang louder behind him.  Into the forest he leapt and crept and jumped and ran, streaming with sweat; seeing the tall form rise before him, he stopped suddenly, dropped his hands in sullen impotence, and sank panting to the earth. A greyhound shot out of the woods behind him, howled, whined, and fawned before the stranger's feet. Hound after hound bayed, leapt, and lay there; then silently, one by one, and with bowed heads, they crept backward toward the town.  The stranger made a cup of his hands and gave the man water to drink, bathed his hot head, and gently took the chains and irons from his feet. By and by the convict stood up. Day was dawning above the treetops. He looked into the stranger's face, and for a moment a gladness swept over the stains of his face.  \"Why, you are a nigger, too,\" he said.  Then the convict seemed anxious to justify himself.  \"I never had no chance,\" he said furtively.  \"Thou shalt not steal,\" said the stranger.  The man bridled.  \"But how about them? Can they steal? Didn't they steal a whole year's work, and then when I stole to keep from starving--\" He glanced at the stranger.  \"No, I didn't steal just to keep from starving. I stole to be stealing. I can't seem to keep from stealing. Seems like when I see things, I just must--but, yes, I'll try!\"  The convict looked down at his striped clothes, but the stranger had taken off his long coat; he had put it around him and the stripes disappeared.  In the opening morning the black man started toward the low, log farmhouse in the distance, while the stranger stood watching him. There was a new glory in the day. The black man's face cleared up, and the farmer was glad to get him. All day the black man worked as he had never worked before. The farmer gave him some cold food.  \"You can sleep in the barn,\" he said, and turned away.  \"How much do I git a day?\" asked the black man.  The farmer scowled.  \"Now see here,\" said he. \"If you'll sign a contract for the season, I'll give you ten dollars a month.\"  \"I won't sign no contract,\" said the black man doggedly.  \"Yes, you will,\" said the farmer, threateningly, \"or I'll call the convict guard.\" And he grinned.  The convict shrank and slouched to the barn. As night fell he looked out and saw the farmer leave the place. Slowly he crept out and sneaked toward the house. He looked through the kitchen door. No one was there, but the supper was spread as if the mistress had laid it and gone out. He ate ravenously. Then he looked into the front room and listened. He could hear low voices on the porch. On the table lay a gold watch. He gazed at it, and in a moment he was beside it,--his hands were on it! Quickly he slipped out of the house and slouched toward the field. He saw his employer coming along the highway. He fled back in tenor and around to the front of the house, when suddenly he stopped. He felt the great, dark eyes of the stranger and saw the same dark, cloak-like coat where the stranger sat on the doorstep talking with the mistress of the house. Slowly, guiltily, he turned back, entered the kitchen, and laid the watch stealthily where he had found it; then he rushed wildly back toward the stranger, with arms outstretched.  The woman had laid supper for her husband, and going down from the house had walked out toward a neighbor's. She was gone but a little while, and when she came back she started to see a dark figure on the doorsteps under the tall, red oak. She thought it was the new Negro until he said in a soft voice:  \"Will you give me bread?\"  Reassured at the voice of a white man, she answered quickly in her soft, Southern tones:  \"Why, certainly.\"  She was a little woman, and once had been pretty; but now her face was drawn with work and care. She was nervous and always thinking, wishing, wanting for something. She went in and got him some cornbread and a glass of cool, rich buttermilk; then she came out and sat down beside him. She began, quite unconsciously, to tell him about herself,--the things she had done and had not done and the things she had wished for. She told him of her husband and this new farm they were trying to buy. She said it was hard to get niggers to work. She said they ought all to be in the chain-gang and made to work. Even then some ran away. Only yesterday one had escaped, and another the day before.  At last she gossiped of her neighbors, how good they were and how bad.  \"And do you like them all?\" asked the stranger.  She hesitated.  \"Most of them,\" she said; and then, looking up into his face and putting her hand into his, as though he were her father, she said:  \"There are none I hate; no, none at all.\"  He looked away, holding her hand in his, and said dreamily:  \"You love your neighbor as yourself?\"  She hesitated.  \"I try--\" she began, and then looked the way he was looking; down under the hill where lay a little, half-ruined cabin.  \"They are niggers,\" she said briefly.  He looked at her. Suddenly a confusion came over her and she insisted, she knew not why.  \"But they are niggers!\"  With a sudden impulse she arose and hurriedly lighted the lamp that stood just within the door, and held it above her head. She saw his dark face and curly hair. She shrieked in angry terror and rushed down the path, and just as she rushed down, the black convict came running up with hands outstretched. They met in mid-path, and before he could stop he had run against her and she fell heavily to earth and lay white and still. Her husband came rushing around the house with a cry and an oath.  \"I knew it,\" he said. \"It's that runaway nigger.\" He held the black man struggling to the earth and raised his voice to a yell. Down the highway came the convict guard, with hound and mob and gun. They paused across the fields. The farmer motioned to them.  \"He--attacked--my wife,\" he gasped.  The mob snarled and worked silently. Right to the limb of the red oak they hoisted the struggling, writhing black man, while others lifted the dazed woman. Right and left, as she tottered to the house, she searched for the stranger with a yearning, but the stranger was gone. And she told none of her guests.  \"No--no, I want nothing,\" she insisted, until they left her, as they thought, asleep. For a time she lay still, listening to the departure of the mob. Then she rose. She shuddered as she heard the creaking of the limb where the body hung. But resolutely she crawled to the window and peered out into the moonlight; she saw the dead man writhe. He stretched his arms out like a cross, looking upward. She gasped and clung to the window sill. Behind the swaying body, and down where the little, half-ruined cabin lay, a single flame flashed up amid the far-off shout and cry of the mob. A fierce joy sobbed up through the terror in her soul and then sank abashed as she watched the flame rise. Suddenly whirling into one great crimson column it shot to the top of the sky and threw great arms athwart the gloom until above the world and behind the roped and swaying form below hung quivering and burning a great crimson cross.  She hid her dizzy, aching head in an agony of tears, and dared not look, for she knew. Her dry lips moved:  \"Despised and rejected of men.\"  She knew, and the very horror of it lifted her dull and shrinking eyelids. There, heaven-tall, earth-wide, hung the stranger on the crimson cross, riven and blood-stained, with thorn-crowned head and pierced hands. She stretched her arms and shrieked.  He did not hear. He did not see. His calm dark eyes, all sorrowful, were fastened on the writhing, twisting body of the thief, and a voice came out of the winds of the night, saying:  \"This day thou shalt be with me in Paradise!\"Embed",

        "Juliet LyricsJuliet, Juliet You've got the smile that I can't forget On the day we met I made a bet Some day I'll win the love of Juliet  Long as the sand, bright as the sun Where have you been since my life begun Girl you're the one that I want to know Juliet let me be your Romeo  Friendly smile a sexy walk A charming little accent when you talk You're an eleven on a scale of ten Juliet I just wanna say it again  Just a little bit shy, just a little bit quiet I don't mind, I'm in love and I can't deny itEmbed",
        "Mary's Place Lyrics[Verse 1] I got seven pictures of Buddha, the prophet's on my tongue Eleven angels of mercy sighing over that black hole in the sun My heart's dark but it's rising, I'm pulling all the faith I can see From that black hole on the horizon, I hear your voice calling me  [Pre-Chorus] Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it rain Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain  [Chorus] Meet me at Mary's place, we're going to have a party Meet me at Mary's place, we're going to have a party Tell me how do we get this thing started? Meet me at Mary's place Meet me at Mary's place  [Verse 2] Familiar faces around me, laughter fills the air Your loving grace surrounds me, everybody's here Furniture's out on the front porch, music's up loud I dream of you in my arms, I lose myself in the crowd  [Pre-Chorus] Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it rain Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain [Chorus] Meet me at Mary's place, we're going to have a party Meet me at Mary's place, we're going to have a party Tell me, how do you live broken-hearted? Meet me at Mary's place Meet me at Mary's place  [Bridge] Meet me at Mary's place Meet me at Mary's place  [Verse 3] I got a picture of you in my locket, I keep it close to my heart This light shining in my breast, leading me through the dark Seven days, seven candles in my window, light your way Your favorite record's on the turntable, I drop the needle and pray  [Verse 4] Band's counting out midnight, floor's rumbling loud Singer's calling up daylight, waiting for that shout from the crowd Waiting for that shout from the crowd Waiting for that shout from the crowd Waiting for that shout from the crowd Waiting for that shout from the crowd Waiting for that shout from the crowd [Pre-Chorus] Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up  [Chorus] Meet me at Mary's place, we're going to have a party Meet me at Mary's place, we're going to have a party Tell me how do we get this thing started? Meet me at Mary's place Meet me at Mary's place Meet me at Mary's place Meet me at Mary's place Meet me at Mary's place Meet me at Mary's place Oh, meet me at Mary's place Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it rain Let it rain, let it rain, let it rainEmbed",
